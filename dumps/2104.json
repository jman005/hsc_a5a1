[{"id": 2104, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Tavros is basically a goofy nerd kid who just likes goofy nerd kid games. Like this fucked-up alien version of Pok\u00e9mon. It's a little more complicated and biologically rigorous than Pok\u00e9mon though, and therefore summoning your creature friend/warrior is a slower process. You have to factor gestation time into your battle strategy.  It's doubtful Vriska would mess around with a soft kiddie game like this. She only deals in the hard stuff, like Flarp, and almost certainly bullied Tavros into doing the same. Before his accident, of course.", "notes": null}]
