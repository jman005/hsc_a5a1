He stashed it in here along with his taxidermied loved ones. This Fourth Wall becomes a very important object later, as does the stuffed Jade. Just seeing that they exist in this lab in this one frame is important information to stash in your back pocket. We're still collecting plot tokens to cash in down the road. Do we ever stop? Nope. Don't worry though, at least the dead dog remains safely useless from now on."}]
