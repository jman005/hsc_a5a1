In hindsight though, one wonders how much of this gesture was altruism and how much was just a convenient excuse to have access to a huge surge of  fresh brown blood. If there's anyone who'd have a moral objection to this, it wouldn't be Equius, who's too creepy, and it wouldn't be Tavros, who's too stupid. Also, he'd probably be too busy screaming to even notice, having just had his legs chopped off.", "notes": null}]
