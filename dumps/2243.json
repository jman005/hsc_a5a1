[{"id": 2243, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "\"Make her pay\" is the same command as the animation sequence that ends Hivebent. Which is also executed by Aradia against Vriska. This was Aradia's first attempt, a fairly weaksauce effort to scare Vriska straight using ghosts of her victims. Obviously that's not going to cut it. You don't write Vriska a check you aren't prepared to  cash. Aradia is much more heavy-handed with her second attempt at making her pay. By then she's armed with a sick robot body, a compromised conscience, and a whole lot of pent-up rage.", "notes": null}]
