To be fair, Operation Regisurp-an actual, detailed plan of betrayal contained in an actual folder-appears to be much better thought out than the tactic he was using in the human session. Which consisted of occasionally handing a regisword to anyone wandering through his office, like a  confused mail lady, and hoping they would take it upon themselves to assassinate the rival king or queen. But then, maybe Operation Regisurp is a better plan because it involves ousting his own queen? Now that's a plan he can really throw himself into.", "notes": null}]
