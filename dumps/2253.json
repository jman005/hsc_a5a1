[{"id": 2253, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "This sums it all up pretty well. And I've already indulged in a lot of meta about him down here, prior to this page. What else is there to say? Probably a lot, once he actually starts doing things. Let's wait for him to do those things, then. For now it's worth noting that we can't \"control\" him. Meaning he doesn't respond to reader commands. The next page says it's because he's a First Guardian, which is a cagey explanation. It's also because he's an author-tier character. As I've said before, the more powerful and villainous a character is, the higher up the metaladder they reside. Jack is higher than most characters due to his utilization of a Fourth Wall and  appearance in narrative proximity to the author himself (my orange fingers typing his name). Doc is much higher than that. The first true alt-author of the story, but not the last.", "notes": null}]
