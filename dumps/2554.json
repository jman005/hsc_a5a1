So she hits up Terezi, then comes back when the coast is clear. She likes both the Scourge girls, but Vriska clearly is her favored daughter. Can't say I blame her. To her, Vriska's like... What's the waifu equivalent of a daughter? Wait, that was a weird question, never mind. I like to think that she counsels Vriska a little on her broken-heart matters right after this. I can't imagine Snowman having anything but raw contempt for Tavros and the idea that he and her beloved Scourge daughter could ever be a couple. She probably helps Vriska understand important things such as: you don't need this complete fool in your life. He's utterly beneath you, and someday perhaps you'll find the sense to run a lance through his chest. Maybe I'll even covertly arrange for you to come into possession of my own lance for this purpose so that you do not forget my advice.", "notes": null}]
