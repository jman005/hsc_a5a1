[{"id": 2083, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "What Terezi probably means to say is, it makes her sad to talk to Aradia ever since Vriska mind-controlled Sollux into murdering Aradia with his eye beams and turned her into a depressed ghost. That's probably a pretty awkward fact to bring up, though. Come to think of it, as of this moment, I don't actually remember who is currently aware that Aradia is a ghost? Equius is, because he's building a robot body for her. Vriska PROBABLY is, because she killed her. But I believe everyone else is under the impression that she just...showed up again online after her \"accident,\" and therefore survived somehow. INCLUDING Sollux, who was the triggerman, and Terezi, who maimed Vriska in revenge for this act. This is going to remain my recollection of the facts until the story corrects me on any of this.", "notes": null}]
