[{"id": 2325, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "It seems this is the first clear confirmation that Kanaya is awake on Prospit while she sleeps? It may have been hinted at before, but now all doubt is removed. Again, just like Jade. We'll need to put a pin in that and remember to keep an eye out for why it's true. Also like Jade, she has a wardrobifier. But unlike Jade, she actually likes a wide variety of fashion, which she sews herself. So she actually gets some good use out of it, rather than cycling through a bunch of silly tee-shirts. The chainsaw-to- lipstick is some standard item duality inherited from Problem Sleuth, like Snowman's lance/cigarette holder. But in this case, this particular item actually existed in the other story and was the weapon/cosmetic of choice for Hysterical Dame. Hence the odd reference to getting \"hysterical\" here, which probably seems like a weird line if you don't have the scoop.", "notes": null}]
