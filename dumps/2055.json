It's kind of a cute and fun idea to imagine that this was true. But let's get real. This relationship never went fucking anywhere.\n\nShe's alluding to Equius here, but we don't know that yet. We can only guess which of the unintroduced trolls she's referring to at this point. He also sounds ominous. Possibly abusive? Before we get to know him, there are many clues that Equius is an unspeakably horrid troll. These clues turn out to be pretty misleading. He's actually sort of a powderpuff. A sweaty, creepy, unbelievably racist powderpuff.", "notes": null}]
