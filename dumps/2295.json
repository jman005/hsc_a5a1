[{"id": 2295, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Nepeta is standing in for the fandom here, updating her shipping wall with this stunning development, as must we all. Even though she didn't see this one coming, she must have given it brief consideration, since she clearly drew it in advance. But it seems she's drawn all ships in advance, and only has to circle ones that come to pass, while simply leaving commentary on others. Very convenient. We can draw a few insights from this. First, obviously we note she has an unrequited thing for Karkat, which is critical information, especially to the avid Nepkat loyalists out there. We also see she considers Gamzee <3 Terezi to be a crack ship. (She's right,  sort of.) And there's confirmation that she and Equius are moirails, even though we don't know what that means yet. In fact, this visual aid is a good clue that helps us start figuring some stuff out about troll romance on our own, even before I felt it some combination of necessary and hilarious to dump approximately 100,000  words on the subject into the story all at once.", "notes": null}]
