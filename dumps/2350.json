One that's a little easier to miss is the fact that she put his totem lathe about as far away from his hive as possible, for basically no reason.\n\nIt's actually a really good idea for Tavros to commune with the imps to carry him up the stairs. But he's too much of a wuss to actually do it. Vriska was even willing to allow this, which is practically letting him cheat. If anything, she's way too easy on him. I guess flushed feelings will do that to a girl.", "notes": null}]
