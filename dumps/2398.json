[{"id": 2398, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The previous note implies red infidelity is a lot less common than black infidelity, which is probably true. But the info on red/black vacillation here implies that when red infidelity does occur, it's more likely the result of two partners flipping between red and black erratically, leaving themselves open to courting other people in  the red quadrant while the couple is in their black moods. Romantic life for trolls is pretty dramatic. Hence the need for the pale relationships, which serve as social stabilizers. When you look at it that way, it starts to make more sense why the escalation of romantic complexity isn't linear, it's geometric. In other words, to expand on our human \"system,\" you can't really just add a spade and be done with it. You're adding too much drama. So you need another two to counterbalance. So a 1A1  system becomes a 242 grid. Extrapolating further, to add another heart- or spade-equivalent symbol to that, you'd realistically be stretching the system out to a 343 grid. (And no, I will NOT be talking about leprechaun romance here, although I know you want me to.)", "notes": null}]
