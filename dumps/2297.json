[{"id": 2297, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Another \" for girls\" comment. Which, judging from how this expression was used earlier in reference to Flarp, probably just means that troll romance movies are really violent. Which makes perfect sense, of course. Also you can't really tell here, but Karkat's blood color in that GIF image was cycling through a few colors, to  keep it a \"mystery.\" Sometimes Homestuck does this, protects a piece of information it isn't ready to reveal yet by presenting it in plain sight but obscuring the thing in question in some manner, This is also done with the name of Kanaya's land.\n\nKarkat has a funny attitude regarding Jack. If one of his friends slights him in the smallest way in conversation, he explodes and goes on a lengthy, indignant tirade. But if Jack stabs him, Karkat bends over backwards to excuse him, rationalizing that it's just his way of being friendly or something. He seems to admire Jack, and respects his ruthlessness. Or at least he thinks he does. There's almost a paternal quality to the relationship, like Jack is the father Karkat never had (Except...he did have a father? A crab monster father, though. It's not quite the same.) Or maybe another way of looking at Karkat's behavior toward Jack is more like if Jack were a dangerous animal Karkat respected greatly, that he was trying to tame and befriend, like a tiger. If a wild tiger swipes at you with its claws, you don't take it personally. It's just his nature. You'd probably blame yourself for not being careful enough, and then keep trying to figure out how to connect with the beast. Of course, we're still thinking like humans here. Forming connections with dangerous beasts IS what father-son relationships for trolls are like.", "notes": null}]
