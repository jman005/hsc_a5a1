Nepeta's also got Jade's tablet modus, except really it's just her computer. In the same way that Nepeta is a proto-Calliope, she's also kind of a neo-Jade. Remember how I was talking about all these characters essentially being reconfigurations of various more fundamental, platonic personality profiles, and that Homestuck demonstrates its persona alchemy especially as the roster expands? Nepeta seems to build on Jade as  a core persona, adding other dimensions in the process and thereby creating a new fundamental personality index we can reference thereafter as \"Nepeta.\" And the Nepeta index can undergo further permutations to result in a more focused, substantive avatar called \"Calliope.\" Or a less focused (but still substantive) absolute mess of an avatar called \"Davepeta.\"", "notes": null}]
