[{"id": 2318, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The way Hivebent is written, sometimes it feels like the actual story is put on hold and replaced by \"author notes,\" briefly explaining what actually happened in a loose and whimsical way. As I've said probably ten times now, everything comes back to the fast pacing. It really feels like an advanced exercise in telling a complex long-form story, but in extreme fast-forward. With a gun to my head. And with the Benny Hill music playing. The \"real story\" of Hivebent has been severely compacted, key events of a dramatic nature have been elided, and what's been dropped in its place is just a metric ton of additional fucking sass from yours truly. Notes on a story instead of  a story. And because Homestuck is a neverending metaserpent always eating its own postmodern tail, here we have a printing of such a story, with even more \"author notes\" providing additional layers of quippy blithering. It turns out I may never run out of ways to explain things, or ways to explain all the explanations thereafter.", "notes": null}]
