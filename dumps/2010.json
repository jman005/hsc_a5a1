Gamzee is such a sleeper-disaster for the story, a clown horn  thrown into the gears, which had been operating in reasonably efficient, mechanically sound fashion up to this point.

The train wreck has only just left the  station. But for now, it feels very innocent. We're just getting to know Karkat's infuriating stoner buddy. What could go wrong?", "notes": null}]
