I just used some reduced-opacity brushes to render it, and the same style shows up every now and then. Prospit and Derse are meant to provide good environments for players' various \"awakening experiences,\" which are specific to their circumstances. So it makes some sense that Terezi starts exploring her new sensory abilities in conjunction with her dream self starting to become aware.", "notes": null}]
