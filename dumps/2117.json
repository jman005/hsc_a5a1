Pff, you think I'm gonna DRAW A NEW THING? Dream on, fool. Also the fact that Tavros leaves his window open (i.e. permanently smashed open) on the off chance that a cute fairy girl will fly into his room one night is just  about the saddest thing I've ever seen. I bet Vriska would think so too. It's also so unrealistic, from Vriska's point of view. Everyone knows a spider wouldn't venture out to the den of her prey. She'll wait in her own territory, spin a web, set a trap, and let him come to her.", "notes": null}]
