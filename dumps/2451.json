Eridan is a full-blown nastyboy, and younger Dave starts out with some edgy habits too. Not that bad, though. You get the sense that with the wrong influence, Dave could have slipped down the nastyboy road and gone full Eridan. Instead, he follows the path of the wokeboy, which is probably a better outcome for everyone. Dave's proximity to shitty swords, Eridan's proximity to shitty wands-there's some thematic linkage in that both say something about the character. Dave's involved with shitty swords, i.e. false/brittle talismans of ersatz heroism, which break, and the broken sword symbolism linked to his identity  is something he must contend with in his journey, deriving whatever meaning from it that he can. Eridan's shitty wands, i.e. false talismans of magic, known and disdained for their fakeness attribute, serve to challenge him to override that fakeness through anger and determination, as well as the channeling of his aspect,  Hope, as a means of conquering the forces of impotence ruling his identity, which the useless wands seem to physically embody. Of course, unlike Dave's path, his is an unambiguously villainous trajectory.", "notes": null}]
