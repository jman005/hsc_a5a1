[{"id": 2346, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Jade was the last-introduced, combo-breaking kid, who came across as generally \"overpowered\" in terms of her foresight, access to knowledge and tech, and overall handle on the situation compared to her friends, who were all disasters. Kanaya is like that too, but with an even more expansive range of foreknowledge and reliable sources. She has cloud visions like Jade, but also, surprise! She's been reading Rose's game walkthrough too, not only prepping for the game itself but also laying the groundwork for knowing who the human kids are when she sees them. While Jade was uniquely armed with these benefits, for Kanaya it's a bit less remarkable, considering there are others in the group with high levels of advanced knowledge too, with Aradia topping them all. The fact that Kanaya's foreknowledge assets  don't make her exceedingly special in the group lets her fly under the radar a little more, sit back, and use that knowledge in more of a supporting role to her friends, which suits her personality. Like it says on the previous page, she's not meddling or mediating, she's HELPING, dammit!", "notes": null}]
