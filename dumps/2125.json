[{"id": 2125, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Re: more parallels, that egg there is the same graphic asset as the egg Dave needed to hatch to enter his session. It's a test of patience and resolve, involving the imposition of the need for the character to wait for their surroundings to become warm enough for the egg to hatch. In Dave's case, this entails meteors burning down his city. In this case, meteors burning down this forest. But for Terezi this is not a test of patience so much as a diabolical, fatalistic construction which acknowledges eons in advance that this egg will only hatch under the grimmest of circumstances. When the egg hatches, the baby dragon flies away, and the mother grub skull falls and pushes the doomsday button. Terezi always knew that getting to meet her lusus would coincide with the end of the world. She just didn't know why.", "notes": null}]
