[{"id": 2592, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "It's left understated what a dreadful upgrade the enemies received when Gi'bgolyb was prototyped. The one being who can psychically kill all trolls any time it wants, giving its powers to... thousands of enemies who want nothing more than to kill a bunch of trolls. It stands to reason the lesser underlings have watered-down versions of this power. I wonder what that means. Can imps give the trolls nosebleeds? Mild headaches? What about the bigger ones? Could they put trolls in comas? Did  the trolls develop any kind of suppression technology for this, like cool helmets? Man, I don't remember seeing any cool helmets. Who knows, really. This does help underscore what a critical role Aradia played in the final fight, though. The king probably has fully developed Vast Glub powers. This is like one of those hideously unbeatable end bosses who does a single attack to wipe out your party at the beginning of the fight. And part of the challenge is figuring out the one really hard thing you need to accomplish to neutralize that attack, before you begin even considering the real challenge.", "notes": null}]
