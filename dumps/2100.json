Also, it should be noted that we aren't that excited about this intro, because the dude kinda sucks. Okay, just pulling your chain, Tavros has his fans. You know who you are out there. I mean, he's fine. You can't make a lot of good characters unless you have a few bad ones to provide foils for the good ones, to show by contrast how good they are compared to the lame ones. On the subject of bad characters designed to be shitty foils for good ones, be sure to pay special attention to all the fairy troll posters and wallpaper he's got around. This should wet our whistles for the best character of all, who should be coming up soon. So be strong, be brave, as you soldier through the Tavros Badlands. Things will get better soon, I promise.", "notes": null}]
