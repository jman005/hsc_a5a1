[{"id": 2158, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The saddest thing about the line \"It sure will be sad when she dies\" is that it applies just as much to Nepeta herself as it does to Pounce. Speaking of Pounce, if you ask me what's up with her double mouth, the answer obviously is I don't have the slightest idea. The typing quirk came before the lusus design. And the quirk tied to the number 33, arsenic's atomic number. And 3 is a good shape for making a cat face. And there are two of them. So I guess the number always implied a creature with a double cat mouth, and the thing just kind of designed itself? Sometimes that's just how things work. Maybe each mouth connects to a distinct digestive  tract, for different types of prey? Maybe for things that are poisonous and things that aren't? I dunno, I've given you enough here to brainstorm with. Get out your workbooks and go worldbuild this stuff yourselves.", "notes": null}]
