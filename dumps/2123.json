[{"id": 2123, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "This is about as bad as it gets. Tavros talking to Gamzee, or if you will, the peanut butter and jelly duo. PB&J was a peak woobie ship, very popular among people who go in for that sort of thing, and probably was mostly fueled by this one pointless conversation they had. There are also credible indications that Gamzee has some sort  of legitimate red feelings toward Tavros. They are innocent enough in contexts such as this. But later he expresses those feelings inappropriately, by passionately kissing Tavros's severed head.\n\nAlmost every troll class has a special badass-sounding adult troll profession. Among those mentioned are: threshecutioners, cavalreapers, legislacerators, gamblignants, and probably a bunch of others that go unnamed by the story. Laughsassin is apparently one such career path for purple-blooded clownfolk. I don't know what  laughsassins actually do. Probably kill lots of people? I just know that laughsassin is a very good word, and is just one more exhibition of impeccable worldbuilding on my part.", "notes": null}]
