[{"id": 2397, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "This diagram is kind of funny, because these three never even formalize a real auspisticeship. Kanaya just kind of moonlights as a wannabe auspistice, while the other two can't even make up their minds about whether they have a serious blackrom attraction that's in need of mediation or not. It's just used as an example because it's the closest we've come to seeing the real deal in canon so far. It's also worth noting the existence of this quadrant culturally arises from the need to suppress trolls! general inclination to devolve into blackrom sluts. Note there's no auspistice equivalent for red romance, implying that temptation toward red infidelity is nowhere near as big a problem in troll culture. This paints a pretty good picture of what average life is like for trolls with their quadrants filled.", "notes": null}]
