If I recall correctly, there weren't many names to choose from that I thought were decent. The only other one there I remember was Meenah, but that's only because I double-dipped back into the old box for the Alpha Troll names. Pretty sure peixe is Portuguese for \"fish.\" The \"x\" is soft, like pie-she's.", "notes": null}]
