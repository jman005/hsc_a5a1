Maybe even close to Equius-strong? That's a hell of a jump she did, just like Equius. It makes sense that those of her blood class would be sturdy as hell, judging from what we know about the Condesce.  Anyway, this looks to be plausibly the happiest moment of her life, launching herself out of her stuffy old fishbowl-castle toward freedom, and possibly a new boyfriend she has to go kiss back to life. Too bad this is pretty much her peak moment.", "notes": null}]
