[{"id": 2171, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Flarp is just another gross troll game involving weird creatures laying eggs and such. Flarp, you may be smart enough to deduce, is a portmanteau of LARP (live  action roleplay) and, get this, the word \"flap,\" which is a thing that bats do with their wings. I know, how do I come up with this amazing shit? The game has some augmented reality-like features, which makes it feel a bit prescient for something created back in 2010. The \"flapstractions\" (another incredible portmanteau) are virtual entities that fly around the real world and project certain images, like monsters, to make it feel like the game is taking place around you. Makes me wonder  if the makers of Fiduspawn ever used this technology to make Fiduspawn GO.", "notes": null}]
