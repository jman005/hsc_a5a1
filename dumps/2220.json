[{"id": 2220, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Background Aurthour Swiffering up the spilled milk is one of the purest things ever to happen in the comic. The friend/enemy Equius is about to talk to is Gamzee. It's another odd and rather forgettable fact that he has a habit of talking to Gamzee every day. He has a frustrating relationship with Gamzee, because literally everyone does. Equius's daily objective is to simultaneously prostrate himself before a superior while ripping him to shreds for his clowny, stoner demeanor and absolute failure to behave in keeping with his station of superiority. The tension is very titillating for Equius, as it seems all inner conflict is. It's a daily regimen that verges on erotic, and this dynamic finally culminates in a fairly graphic way during the \"murderstuck\" phase of Act 5. That they speak so often leads to some interesting questions about them. How close are they, really? What on earth do they talk about every day, aside from Equius telling him how reprehensible he thinks he is? Equius, along with all his other traits, is very mysterious. Nobody ever really knows what he's up to. Vriska, a cunning person herself, seems clueless as to his Aradiabot double-cross. He operates in the shadows, or \"dark spots,\" as a Void player. Even Doc can't see what he's up to, for the most part.", "notes": null}]
