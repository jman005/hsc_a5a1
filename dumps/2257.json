But the analogy describing his state of confusion, dark water sloshing inside the cavity in his head, describes the structure of a magic 8-ball. Which is one of his cue balls as well. I see this as a literal description of the actual way his head is designed too. Dark water sloshing around. But there  probably isn't a fortune-telling tetrahedron floating around in there. Instead, whatever's in there probably serves as a sort of grim kernel for the final emergence of his master when the time comes. Maybe it's a little Caliborn fetus? Wait, I've said too much, yet again.", "notes": null}]
