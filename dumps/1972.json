He's seen cloud visions too, surely. And he's got this big damn battleship somehow, which never has been and never will be explained. Possibly he bartered for it with some chess guys? Who knows. But anyway, if he knew Jade was dead, that means he specifically made the trip to Skaia for the purpose of retrieving her corpse so that he may stuff and mount her in memoriam. He also kindly drops off Dad and Mom so they can begin their honeymoon getaway. Which he probably also knows to be doomed. It's unlikely he told them though."}]
