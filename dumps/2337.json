[{"id": 2337, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Salvaging the matriorb from her dead mom is a somewhat minor event folded into Kanaya's formal introduction. But it's a small yet meaningful act that kicks off her entire character arc, pertaining to her maternal duty and struggle to revive her dead race, which is a quest that manages to persist all the way to the end. For that reason, Kanaya feels like she has an unusually coherent heroic arc by Homestuck standards. Setting up a thing she has a burning need to do --> ongoing, mighty struggle to do the thing, with many setbacks --> final success in doing the thing, which works out great --> the end. Even the basic premise of Homestuck as a heroic journey for the protagonists isn't like that. They do end up creating a universe in the end, after a ridiculous number of setbacks. But it was never established as a goal from the start. The characters had to meander for a long time until they finally understood what the objective was. In fact, as of this moment in the story, we still don't know what Sburb does. So let's take a moment to appreciate our friend Kanaya here, for the simplicity and clarity of her goals and desires.", "notes": null}]
