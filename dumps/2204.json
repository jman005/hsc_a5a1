Even though Kanaya is the Jade of the troll session, she's really not much like Jade at all in terms of personality. But aside from that, you can list up a ton of similarities: Space players, living in a cool tower next to a volcano, \"raised\" by a First Guardian, etc. Kanaya even has jade blood.", "notes": null}]
