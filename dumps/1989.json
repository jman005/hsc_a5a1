(612 of course instantly became another special Homestuck number,) This was barely a week after I posted [S] Descend, with all those inter-Act pages coming in the days between. Should I have...stopped for a bit? Planned this big troll arc out? Nah. Onward and upward. Planning is for suckers. About to spend an entire summer building an alien world from scratch, introducing twelve new characters, devising their backstories, tangled web of relationships, and personal arcs, amounting to a rollercoaster ride of teen betrayal and bloodshed? Just fucking do it. We aren't getting any younger."}]
