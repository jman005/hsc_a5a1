[{"id": 2400, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Kanaya/Vriska/Tavros was used as an ashen relationship example a couple pages ago, which I mocked, because it wasn't a strong example. This here is much more accurate. It's also probably a more helpful visual aid of troll romance in practice overall, rather than just in theory. Troll romance is usually a huge mess, involving two or three people flailing around emotionally and locked in vicious cycles with each other. Somebody like Kayana goes, you two are bad news for each other, I gotta step in here. Oh wait, actually I love her, I can't do this, bye. Whoops, they go back to black flirting/sparring. Wait, whoops, now they're in love. But...maybe? No, actually they hate each other, false alarm. The mediator comes back, says holy shit you guys, I've got to put a STOP to this. Rinse and repeat stupidly, forever, or until different romantic players enter the scene and upset the apple cart even more.", "notes": null}]
