John would probably be that way about his movies too, except there's no real organizing principle behind all of them. They're all just a bunch of bad movies from the '80s and '90s, and the underlying theory uniting them all is, \"he just kinda likes them all for some reason, and also, Nic Cage is great.\" It's exactly the kind of attitude that  would piss off a guy like Karkat. Which maybe is partly why John was hate at first sight for him.", "notes": null}]
