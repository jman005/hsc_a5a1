Spades Slick found it in the Felt mansion, which we later discovered was on postapocalypse Alternia. And now we see it here, which gives us a small piece of the puzzle to help figure out exactly how the hell this thing ended up here. Aradia found it on an archeological dig. Meaning it was brought here by a meteor, probably. Meaning it was in the troll session at one point. Now we need to look forward to an explanation of how it got to the troll session. Spoiler: it has something to do with the biggest and most unfathomable time loop in the story, the Amazing Adventures of Lil Cal.", "notes": null}]
