Nothing but fire and brains everywhere. Dave has a similarly inhospitable land, a planet covered in lava, but at least there are cool industrial gear-based ruins and skeletal steel buildings to explore. Sollux just gets a bunch of gross brains harassing him. Just another shitty break for a guy stuck with a hard-luck arc. At least he gets a nice, new fish girlfriend here to help him out with brain- stabbing duty.", "notes": null}]
