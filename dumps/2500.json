[{"id": 2500, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "This is, I think, the start of the tradition of me refusing to do recaps. Or only doing them in kind of a weird way, like typing in white text. They really were a pain to write. They were also kind of useless? Like, if you need them to follow along, then what are you even doing here? It was a bit defiant of me, I know. I often show quite the plucky, rebellious spirit when it comes to rejecting or mocking the very conventions and patterns which I myself established earlier. It's heroic, really. The last stretch of ten pages or so, if nothing else, go a long way toward making it clear that ultimately, the only true hero and villain of the story is me. Just the author against the  whole world, and himself. So inspiring. Extra trivia: maybe it seems odd I'm wearing Kanaya's shirt, but it's just because I'm a Virgo, that's all. My aspect is also Space, just like hers. I took the test and everything.", "notes": null}]
