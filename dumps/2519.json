As we skip ahead to these little snapshots of what things were like during their 612-hour session (about a month), we get a sense that things kind of settle into an agreeable rhythm for a bunch of characters who otherwise might be at odds with each other, as they work together to make progress. Of course, we don't know for sure what things were like with them. They were probably still arguing sometimes, and Vriska was surely being Vriska. But their session lasted long enough that there were days or weeklong stretches where certain activities probably started feeling routine, or even fun. In a way, their monthlong getaway to these fantastical settings probably felt a bit like a big group of friends going away to  summer camp.", "notes": null}]
