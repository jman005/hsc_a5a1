[{"id": 2281, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "There's a John arm. Occasional ribbiting also has really spiced up Aradia's morose personality. Have we talked about Frog Aradia yet? It's an easy thing to forget about her, because she just jumps into the robot body and that's that (until her god tier phase). Every session we know of involves some sort of freakish animal  fusion prototyping. Beta Kid: Bird Dave and Dog Jade. Troll: Frog Aradia. Alpha Kid, pre-retcon: absolute hell-mess of fusion garbage we probably shouldn't bother talking about yet. Alpha Kid, post-retcon: Literally Everyone Is A Cat.\n\nAradia actually turns out to be a very skillful, passive kind of shadow leader, It was her plan all along to assume leadership of the session, and here this ambitious, scheming, weird asshole is just... HANDING her the leadership role, voluntarily. He basically talks himself into it (because he seems to talk himself into everything, with  his sexually-agitated circular nonsense), and she just says fine. With all her cloaked maneuvering, she isn't even that underhanded about any of it. She just surrounds herself with Machiavellian crazy people, and lets all their scams cancel each other out, allowing her to default into this position.", "notes": null}]
