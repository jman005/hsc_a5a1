But it happens casually in the background as a gag, while Jake is being preoccupied and self-absorbed, as usual. I'm sure Dirk, who programmed the robot to do that, thought it would be a really passionate, dramatic gesture like it is here. But it turned out Jake just didn't care. Nobody cared, Dirk. Your feelings just aren't that important, sorry. What's happening here is important, though. This whole sequence was fire. Miss me with your bad and wrong opinions if you disagree.", "notes": null}]
