[{"id": 2239, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "--> Terez insists on handling the Vriska situation herself. Looks like she ends the conversation believing she's convinced Aradia to sit this one out. But this doesn't feel like it's just about averting danger to Aradia, or diffusing a tricky Serket situation like only she knows how to do. It also conveys Terezi's attitude as having a sense of \"responsibility\" toward handling Vriska, partly due to their darkly codependent relationship, but also due to Terezi's attitude toward justice. Terez views herself, almost exclusively, as a dispenser of justice. Exclusively, because she's the only one she knows who cares about justice, and considers morality in those terms. Therefore, if anyone else punishes Vriska, it's merely revenge. Whereas if she does it, it's delivering justice, and hence throughout their mutual arc, Terezi continues to see Vriska as her \"responsibility\" and views herself as the only one who can cause Vriska to face justice for her misdeeds. Vriska, however, does not  see things in terms of justice but rather in terms of a fungible, ever-rationalizable personal morality, making her a strong foil for Terezi's desire to pursue justice. Put more simply, Terezi's ethos concerns bringing justice to those who have wronged others, while Vriska's concerns exacting revenge upon those who have wronged her.", "notes": null}]
