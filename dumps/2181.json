One worrying detail that jumps out is the lusus's black eye, which presents the alarming possibility that he may be the victim of Equius's domestic abuse. The explanation turns out to be more innocent though. Dude is just really strong. The cool kids recognized right away that this lusus design is based on a Humanimal, which were some bad and weird comics I used to make. Just buff guys with animal freak-bodies that almost always had udders, despite always being men. The anthro porn art, which Equius regards as classic, absolutely exquisite masterpieces and priceless works of fine art, also reference my older work. I used to harvest pieces such as these and write very academic reviews and critiques of them. Some of them are pasted directly here on his walls, with  a little obscuring of certain anatomical features. Much later, John's il retcon further obscures a questionable portion of the piece on the right. The speech bubble in that piece, which is native to the original work, says \"I love being STRONG,\" which perfectly captures the spirit of Equius as well as the rather eclectic body of subject matter his character is based on.", "notes": null}]
