[{"id": 2467, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Maybe putting the fish troll inside a big fishbowl was a little on the nose. Wait, what's that? The cat troll's land coming up soon is named LOLCAT? Never mind then. Nothing matters. Feferi's finally getting ready to have The Talk with Eridan. Notice how she waits until she's safely in the session before breaking up with him. It's a bit like moving to a country overseas, then breaking up with your ill-tempered jackass boyfriend over the phone. Not a bad play.\n\nFeferi flips out when Eridan disses her hero Sollux. The writing is on the wall. But really the saddest fucking thing going on here is how, when she tells Eridan she has something to say, he actually thinks there's a chance she's got the same thing on her mind that he does. Like she's about to spill her red feelings to him first and save him the trouble. What do you even do with a guy like this? We don't have the technology yet to build a violin small enough to play for him.\n\nFeferi suddenly fishtailing into more sea puns during her breakup spiel may legitimately be the funniest thing that happens in this entire book. Sea look, even I'm doing it now. Absolutely no one respects Eridan. No body. None of the bodies.", "notes": null}]
