[{"id": 2576, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "--> Quick off-topic note: Karkat's reference to the forty-eight signs is based on the (fake) forty-eight-player Squiddle session that apocryphally created their universe. Back on topic: Karezi as the male/female lead, meant-to-be sort of ship, is, well, it's obvious. It's obvious to me at least, because I'm dangling it out there, obviously. Therefore 1 feel it must be obvious to you. And as such, I feel you must know I see it as obvious, and intend it as obvious, in this big feedback loop of self-evidentiary storycraft and trope jockeying. Any time this is true, I think awareness of the circumstance tends to leak into the consciousness of the characters involved. Characters in HS tend to be pretty self-aware (like Striders and Lalondes), but even the ones that aren't as much (like these two) still tend to carry a form of subconscious self- awareness. (Feel free to chew on this oxymoron for a moment before continuing.) In other words, on some level, Karkat and Terezi both just sort of know they are the male and female leads in a lengthy heroic tale, and thus their sense of this propels them toward attraction, as if satisfying unspoken narrative obligation. This must especially seem true for Karkat, who lives and breathes the tropes of his romance films. -->\n\n--> But that said, all long-road Karezi bummers aside, at least at this moment in the story this thing they have going on here reads as pretty endearing. Like there could still be real promise to whatever's going on here. Could it have worked out nice and fine if Karezi followed a conventionally successful romantic path, and turned out to be endgame as hell? Sure, why not. But it didn't. All I can tell you is, a lot of people went nuts for that little heart he logged back on to share. I wonder how many of those people gradually transmuted into Davekat stans? We may never know.", "notes": null}]
