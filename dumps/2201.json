She finds Kanaya's meddling very bothersome, and calls Kanaya out on the habit often. But by her own admission, Vriska's basically the meddler in chief. She has a pattern of doing this with a lot of her relationships, i.e. projecting when it comes to the defining feature of that relationship. She complains of being the victim, when she's the victimizer. Of being meddled with, when she's the meddler. Of being manipulated, when she's the manipulator. Speaking of manipulators, hey look. Doc is here.", "notes": null}]
