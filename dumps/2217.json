[{"id": 2217, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Equius's black pinstripe leggings are a great design choice. Why did I do this? I don't know, but in his sprite form I probably originally intended them to be socks. But because a sprite's legs are so stumpy, the socks come up to the edge of the shorts, making it seem like they're tights. So when I drew this hero mode shot, I just extrapolated from that. My only regret is not making them just a little shorter, leaving the traditional animezettai ryouiki saucy skin-gap between the top of the stocking and the shorts. As if this panel wasn't steamy enough.", "notes": null}]
