The only thing embarrassing is how much there actually is to say about her relative to her importance, when you start digging into it. The troll personas are related to internet culture archetypes, and hers is the first one that correlates pretty closely with fandom itself, at  least as the cultural concept was taking shape at that time. Her obsession with shipping is closely connected to the focus on romance that Hivebent injected into Homestuck's bloodstream, forever contaminating it for better or worse. Parsing her as the enthusiastic proto-fandom avatar in this respect reveals her as the Calliope of the story before Calliope shows up in Act 6. However, Nepeta's claim to that ambassadorship was responded to by the narrative with arguably ill-spirited rebuke and mistreatment, which I think was something that evolved before I had the chance to sharpen and clarify any meaningful statement the story intended to make about such an avatar. That refinement happens later with Calliope's character, an enthusiastic fandom avatar who is in explicit danger from such forces, but who is otherwise elevated and desianated for protection. revivification. and ultimately. amnesty from the story's various narrative retributions.", "notes": null}]
