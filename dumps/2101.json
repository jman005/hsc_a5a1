And the way he got into the wheelchair fueled some important and dramatic backstory, which helped shape the best character's development. So if may I say: good job, fans, for crippling this kid and thereby allowing Vriska to realize her true potential. It would be pretty great if I spent Tavros's entire intro talking up how great Vriska is. In fact, I'd almost consider it authorial malpractice not to.", "notes": null}]
