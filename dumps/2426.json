[{"id": 2426, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Feferi and Eridan have a little racket going on here. Eridan brutally orphans hundreds of kids, and she feeds their dead lusii to an insatiable monstrosity of the deep. Eridan basically does this due to having a thing for her, but he's stuck in the \"moirail zone\" and therefore feels relegated to providing a series of favors in order to stay in her good graces, which often is how guys who subscribe to friend zone-based ideologies are prone to thinking about such things. Also, he's kind of a murderous asshole who probably just likes killing stuff anyways. Whereas Feferi does this every day to make sure her lusus doesn't throw a tantrum and kill all trolls in the known universe. The burden is a bit lopsided, but hey, they work together to get it done as a team, like a good pair of moirails. At least she seems cheerful about it. In fact, she's cheerful about everything. Except Eridan.", "notes": null}]
