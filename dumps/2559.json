We never actually get to see her interact onscreen with the real, live consorts of her land. I hope she didn't... DEAR GOD. Okay, I'm changing the subject. Snowman instructs Terezi to find the ring she left behind and destroy it so Jack can't use it. This sounds like just a preventive move to avoid the Jack disaster that happens to the human session, and it is. But what she doesn't say is, you need to destroy the ring to win the game anyway. Both rings, actually. Got to throw 'em in a big volcano. Act 7 shows the whole deal quite vividly.", "notes": null}]
