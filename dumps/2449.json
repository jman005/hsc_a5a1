[{"id": 2449, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "in a conversation in human culture. Hivebent never makes a big deal of explicitly stating that trolls are an overwhelmingly bisexual race, but you start to gather that from context on a longer-term basis. On the subject of troll society just being a farcical veneer for human society and examining things relatable on human terms, you get a lot of moments like this, where statements and certain presumptions by characters have very human-centric perspectives that bleed into the text. Homestuck is not exceedingly strict about keeping the tone square with a precise reflection of alien cultural literalism. You could look at this in a couple ways. Either I could just be getting a little lazy sometimes, and I'm just letting human-centric worldviews, customs, verbal patterns, etc., leak into the text because it's just easier doing it that way (YA GOT ME). Or you could view it as a more critical choice to keep characters, interactions, and situations more relatable, more tonally in keeping with presenting this arc as a loosely crafted, humorous sci-fi romp, and shifting the focus toward other elements besides some maniacally constructed xenosociological study. Personally, I tend to gravitate toward explanations for things that make me sound like less of a shithead.", "notes": null}]
