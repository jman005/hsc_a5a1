Absolutely tearing this Upper-Midwest beverage a new asshole and deriding it into oblivion along with all the credulous fools who drink it. But in reality, it's fine. Completely unremarkable in every way, and aside from the fact  that an American cult dedicated to circus rap seems unusually faithful to the product, it's barely worth commenting on at all. The joke here basically is: there is no joke. BA-DUM PSHHI!", "notes": null}]
