[{"id": "001956", "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Sorry ! used the entire previous author note to tell Jake to fuck oll, in the process gilding over so much pertinent trivia, Ut was worth it.) Basically this is a box fu of very small weapons (plus a wielder of those weapons, who will appear in a few pages). He lists the weapon names here because why not? It's cool info. There's a lot we don't yet know about Jake (such as the fact his name is Jake), but we surmise he's from the future, in a manner of speaking, and that he's related to Jade or John due to similarities in demeanor and tastes. If we're REALLY on the ball, we're probably also wondering, \"Isn't this just young Grandpa Harley?\" The answer is yes, of course. The question then is, what does that mean? From what timeline? Why is he helping? Who's twisting his arm? (It's Calliope.) And what, ultimately, is the point of shoving all this deadly stuff in this box and mailing it through time and space anyway? Is the purpose to let Jack use it to kill the queen, fulfilling a dire but critical event in this grand cosmic theater? Or is it something more? The assistance these weapons and this ally would provide later? The answer is never just one thing. In Homestuck, something turning out to be \"essential\" is always justification enough for someone, somewhere, to try to make that thing happen in the first place.", "notes": null}]
