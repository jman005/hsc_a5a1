She may have decided to make  it dice-based technology either because she never wants to bother with any form of weapon that isn't dice or luck-based in some way, or she just wanted to build in a feature that made sure Eridan needed to get extremely lucky to blow up the world. But also, considering Equius was likely the one who built most of this, Equius himself probably sabotaged it so it never had a chance of being that powerful anyway. Why would any of these people want to give their idiot friend the power to blow up the world? Unpacking this ridiculous doomsday device project underscores the fact that, while the entire troll group can unanimously agree on virtually nothing, literally all of them would still agree that Eridan sucks and should never be trusted.", "notes": null}]
