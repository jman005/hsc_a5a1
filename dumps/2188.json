[{"id": 2188, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Even Aradia's random feats of destruction, supposedly done just for the sake of vandalism and desecration, turn out to be not that random. There was a major purpose to the preprototyping of this frog, which ultimately results in the exile of the Black Queen, who later becomes Snowman, i.e. Important Stuff. As Aradia's arc progresses and the ghostly freeze on her emotions and desires begins to thaw, one of the themes that starts emerging is the struggle over the nature of what is random in a universe where any appearance of randomness is prewritten as an essential result, and any act of destruction, no matter how violent or disruptive, only serves as a preconditional pillar for any foretold series of outcomes. As a robot, when she gets her emotional legs back under her somewhat, she gets more aggressive and starts lashing out, using acts of chaos, violence, impulsiveness, and randomness as a kind of protest against the bondage that existing in Paradox Space represents. In other words, there's no random act that reality hasn't accounted for, but aggressively enacting them is still kind of a Fuck You statement to the master. It's an attitude borne by a defiant slave, which she knows herself to be, just like her ancestor.", "notes": null}]
