But she starts out that way, at least in concept. Designing a twelve-troll ensemble before I knew anything about a lot of them meant that a bunch of the designs were sort of these humorous, superficial GESTURES. Ideas that captured internet archetypes that were a bit absurd or cringey. The juggalo troll, the weird horse porn freak troll, the furry girl troll... They all start out as kind of shitty ideas that then receive elaboration and actual character development, which makes them more than the sum of their gimmicks. But the story kind of latches on to her as the poster child for this idea of the \"underdeveloped joke character\" which some fans would demand additional development well beyond reasonable expectation for the station she holds in the story. So some running gags emerge that focus on dragging poor Nepeta back down to irrelevance, or unfairly target her for tragic outcomes. Hence some \"dead Nepeta\" jokes that crop up here and there, which maybe seem cruel, but everything has its reason and fits into a  greater order. In a way, Nepeta's arc could be seen as the struggle to ultimately free herself from the cycle of narrative marginalization and abuse.
