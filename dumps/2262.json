[{"id": 2262, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "We didn't know what Vriska's Vision Eightfold was until now. Seemingly it alluded to some vague power to see the future? That turns out to be true, indirectly. It's just a kind of X-ray vision. It's unclear how necessary her special lenses are to use the power. I'd probably look at it as a kind of jeweler's loupe, magnifying her power to see clearly, but not essential. It's not the most amazing superpower, but combined with her mind-control abilities, it makes for a pretty good accessory power. The way she chooses to use it is telling. She's effectively mimicking prognosticative powers by stealing fortunes from another source, by peering through an opaque surface never meant to be breached. She's essentially outsourcing her prediction powers and taking credit, just like she does with machine-building skills and other people's bodies, including the use of their powers. All she ever does is use her abilities to hack the system in various ways, looking for cheats, shortcuts, and end-runs, seizing power, knowledge, relevance, and glory using the absolute least-resistance method available. She is a consummate thief.", "notes": null}]
