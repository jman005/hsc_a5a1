[{"id": 2226, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "There are so many dimensions of creepiness to this, it's hard to keep track of them all. One detail worth cocking an eyebrow over is the \"class upgrade\" this represents for Aradia. Strangely, though Equius is attracted to her swill-blooded untouchable status, he does what he probably presumes is the sweeping romantic gesture of upgrading her to the same blood class as him, even though this gesture sort of neutralizes the very class divide he finds so intoxicatingly depraved. He may view this as a \"sacrifice\" he is making for her benefit. But what's probably even more creepy about this, when you think it through, is that as he was building this thing, the most logical and direct supply of indigo blood was probably his own body. He's essentially giving her a full-body blood transfusion using his own blood, so that she gets to experience the privilege of being his true equal. The creepiness is probably compounded by the fact that this robot surely doesn't need any blood inside it at all to function. It's strictly symbolic.", "notes": null}]
