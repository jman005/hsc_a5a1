Did we ever see it?\" So, yeah, it's a scratch and sniff modus, because she's blind and smells stuff, and also has a coin. Not a bad gag answer to that question, huh? Basically every troll modus is some form of gag relating to their character traits. The modus progression goes like this. First three kids: all data structure modi, very serious and mostly terrible. Jade: combo breaker, ridiculous board-game mod, establishing the precedent that a modus can be anything, there are no rules. Trolls: lots of silly joke modi after that, continuing the trend that they can be anything, even stupid things, and nothing really matters. The Alpha Kid modi mostly continue that trend too.", "notes": null}]
