[{"id": 2098, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "She also (wow, this is a lot of info...) lives in a desert and has a floating grub lusus, (That's gotta be a mother grub, right? Yes, it is.) She likes putting colorful crap on things. Unlike the other trolls, she goes out during the day. She lives in a carbon copy of Jade's house. This implies that Jade's house is a universally available model  to be salvaged from Sburb ruins and constructed, which is what Grandpa must have done. And (per the panel on next page) she has her own set of frog ruins, buried  in the sand next to her Jade-like house, along with what appears to be the top of a volcano, also buried deep in sand, and also echoing Jade's setup. The sight of red ruins clues us into the fact that this planet has two distinct set of ruins, with six orbiting planets each. This makes sense to us now that we're well versed in the red/blue team logic of this arc, each team with six players. In fact, the presence of blue ruins with six planets made it possible to guess that similar red ruins existed somewhere else for this reason (and I'm sure this was correctly predicted by some people). Also, the sand has the same crazy color scheme as the desert we saw SS in during the Intermission, making it EXTRA obvious this is taking place on the same planet (though the green and pink moons orbiting Alternia already made that obvious).", "notes": null}]
