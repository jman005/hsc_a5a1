[{"id": 2268, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The moment this happened marked the beginning of Vriska's \"bad luck,\" by her own estimation. (Doc alluded to this.) Which means that she has been associating \"good luck\" with \"access to reliable foreknowledge.\" Makes sense from a Light aspect standpoint, where luck and knowledge are closely related ideas. After she loses her Vision Eightfold and her cue ball intel edge, she starts flying blind, as it were. She blames her inability to cheat using stolen knowledge on a deficit of luck and desperately starts seeking good information from lesser sources, like 8-balls, which she then starts habitually cracking open with a sense of addictive frustration. She starts to come across as a kind of luck/knowledge junkie, looking to duplicate a high she once had, which can never be obtained again. And like a junkie, she keeps digging herself deeper into the hole she's trying to get out of with each \"hit\" she takes, since breaking 8-balls supposedly brings you bad luck. It's a vicious cycle.", "notes": null}]
