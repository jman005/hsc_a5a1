[{"id": 2205, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Vriska, basically: Fine, mom, 1! go check on my other mom. On the matter of Kanaya's maternality again... Every troi! obviously started with one very basic idea, something tied to their zodiac sign, which then informed their troll handle and led to various points of characterization. Virgo was a tricky one. What do you do with virginity? Kanaya's handle is grimAuxiliatrix. Auxiliatrix is a term associated with the Virgin Mary. So in Christianity at least, virginity has mythological association with motherhood. And thus we have something to build on. Themes of motherhood run all throughout Kanaya's arc, in some pretty literal ways. (For her ancestor, blatantly literal when it comes to Christian lore parallels.) But it's more than just content for an arc. Maternal impulses are woven into her characterization. She acts this way toward Vriska (but only while she has a thing for her), toward Karkat, and later toward her girifriend as she helps her through her struggles. Basically she's like this with  people she cares about, and not so much with those she doesn't. It also goes a long way toward explaining her gravitation toward the thankless ashen quadrant and natural talent for being an auspistice. I just know you're jittering in anticipation for the dirt on quadrants. Patience.", "notes": null}]
