[{"id": 2071, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "This was also my way of saying \"Yeah, I'm not going to bother making a Flash animation for this battle.\" Flashes, even though I made them pretty fast generally, were brutal to make, even the strife sequences. This would have meant two or three days of no content just to put up a meaningless fray with a crab monster. So I made a joke about it, and linked to a song you could imagine playing during the battle (obviously the song is not available to play in this book). Sometimes by making an obvious demonstration of what I'm NOT doing (while joking about it) is a way of signalling what I consider to be most important to focus on at this moment of the story. And in this case it's: speed. Getting through this wild alien arc as fast as we can, cutting whichever corners I say don't matter.", "notes": null}]
