[{"id": 2216, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "It's an obscure fact that Aurthour is one of the strongest lusii on the planet. He appears to be a miniature version of something in the musclebeast family, specifically from a race of centaur butlers. (We see much bigger versions of these on Jake's island.) This helps establish the magnitude of Equius's strength. It's like the common trope where you show a strong guy, just so another stronger guy can defeat him easily, to show how strong the REALLY strong guy is. Except it's a classic twist on the trope: show a guy's really strong dad, and demonstrate how easily he is bruised at the slightest loving touch from his son. If only we had a nickel for every time we've seen it.", "notes": null}]
