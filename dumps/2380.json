[{"id": 2380, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The saddest thing about Tavros is he has no game whatsoever. Look at this pitiful display. Vriska is working SO hard to get this romance off the ground. Buttering him up with a number of insults and belittling remarks, after going to all the trouble of setting this clever trap and dressing as his favorite fake thing in the world, a sexy fairy. This seems to be what pisses her off the most about him. She can read his feelings well enough, since she's psychic, so it's not like she's imagining things. She gives him these \"opportunities\" to prove himself, which, yes, may be a bit aggressive. But this is just her way, and he knows it. Yet, each chance she gives  him, he beefs it every time. Completely exhausting. Once again, Vriska manages to be the most sympathetic figure in virtually any interaction she has in the comic. Undeniable FACT.", "notes": null}]
