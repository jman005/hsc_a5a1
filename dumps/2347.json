[{"id": 2347, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The get the sense at Ranaye isn t reading the wa'kthrough main'y as a means of technica! research into the game, but more as an intriguing narrative to Start burlaing fantasies around, like her grim literature. Here's her troll-normative visualization of Rose, because, well, why wouldn't an alien just look kinda like a troll? Horns are normal, and so is gray skin, so yeah, why not. If Kanaya were trying to be realistic, she'd probably give Rose more alien qualities, but her imagination is being lazy, and the only point of this fantasy is to imagine how cool Rose is so she can develop a preemptive crush on her. This provides us with a lot of retroactive perspective on all the Rose-Kanaya conversations we've read. There is a tone of bitterness and scorn running through Kanaya's earlier dialogue with Rose that isn't fundamental to her personality otherwise. This explains why. Kanaya is underwhelmed and disillusioned with her heroine of legend, so she begins by cooperating with Karkat's trolling orders  and treats Rose with nothing but derision. It's only a bit later, when Rose starts holding her own in certain conversations and pulls off a few badass moves for the camera, that Kanaya's earlier heroine-crush starts to rekindle itself.", "notes": null}]
