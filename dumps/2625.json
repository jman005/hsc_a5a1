[{"id": 2625, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "where any of this came from. Like one time back in 2010 1 jazz-handsed a bit too hard, and this stull just sort of magically appeared, thus basically turning Homestuck into \"That Fucking Troll Comic\" instead. It all seems pretty nuts now, like a particularly garish display of creative intensity. Making Hivebent took exactly one summer. For the duration of only that summer, I lived in somebody's weird and terrible house. My roommate I think was some sort of criminal? He was bad news. He had two huge dogs that honestly struck me as mostly untamed and bloodthirsty creatures. The result of this living arrangement was that I spent almost twenty- four hours a day locked in my shitty little room, working on this nonstop. Maybe that's where the thing with me being stuck in an attic with the wolf head came from? Actually that's probably exactly where it came from. When I spell it all out like this, it doesn't seem mysterious at all. Anyway, when Hivebent was done, I escaped from that dude's house and went on to greener pastures (i.e. mostly a bunch of other shitty apartments, but involving fewer dangerous animals). Thanks for listening to a small slice from my life as a ceaseless, roving drifter. And good job getting through this book. You've earned yourself a little break before moving on to the next one. Not me. thouah. T'l clearly be writina notes an this series for the rest of my life.", "notes": null}]
