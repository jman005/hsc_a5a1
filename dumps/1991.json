Probably some people wonder why I did this. I guess it was a joke? I couldn't fully explain why it's a joke, or why it's funny. It may not even be funny, in any conventional sense. Suffice it to say that sometimes I perceive humor in that which is so blatantly lazy and stupid, one can barely escape concluding that the intent was to offend the intellect. Okay, so I guess I fucking explained it? Consider it explained. Also the first \"failed\" planet name was TURDODOR FUCKBALL, I believe. The planetary equivalent of ZOOSMELL  POOPLORD. The \"real\" name was gathered from reader suggestions, like all twelve trolls in this arc. Actually, Toby Fox was the one who suggested Alternia. So let's give him credit for that too, in addition to about a thousand cool songs."}]
