[{"id": 2448, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Feferi's quirk, I gotta admit, is another rough one. Swapping H with )( just turns out to be a tough read, IMO. It's definitely a good idea, visually referencing the Pisces symbol in that way, similar to how Eridan references his wavy symbol (and accent, apparently) with vv and ww. But it doesn't do the eye any favors in terms of readability, and possibly contributed to my disinclination to give Feferi much dialogue in the story. Note later how Meenah doesn't have this quirk, unless she's shouting.", "notes": null}]
