[{"id": 2331, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "\"Death is pretty confusing without the finality\" is the tagline for Homestuck. Having now owned myself, as well as my great comic, let's look back at the previous conversation again. It's worth noting the allusion to Kanaya's relationship with Vriska, which Feferi presumes to be moirallegiance. Not unreasonably, since Kanaya's stated task is to keep an eye on Vriska for her own good. But that's kind of a mixed signal she's sending, since clearly she has other designs; notice how she says she doesn't \"want her to be that,\" implying she'd rather Vriska was something more. This gives us a glimpse into the psychology surrounding troll romance, which we're only still figuring out through inference. Sometimes trolls get locked into quadrants, or trap themselves into them through mixed signals, as Kanaya has done. Similar to  getting \"Friend zoned\" by a crush, but with even more exotic social compartments to get stuck in. For instance, if you have a red crush on someone, and your strategy is to neg them into liking you, then whoops, you might end up in the black quadrant instead.", "notes": null}]
