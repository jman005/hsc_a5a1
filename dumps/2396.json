That's because I didn't think it was tonally responsible to get into graphic explanations about the mechanics of troll fornication. That was a good call at the time, but I see no reason why I should present myself as similarly encumbered in these books. How do they provide so much fluid for the heart or spade pail? I believe it's been  implied that the mutual result of the red or black concupiscent ritual is the prodigious vomiting of genetic material. Though to be perfectly honest, I can't remember at all if this was implied anywhere in the text, or just in my imagination at some point over the last eight years.", "notes": null}]
