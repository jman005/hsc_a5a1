Which means they had to slay one frog of sorts to make way for another. But the frog they make ends up dying later as well. Too bad. Here's a thing about this lilypad platform here: it's a game construct meant to assist with fighting the king. The king is a huge, towering end boss, and video games usually provide the player with some means of actually getting close enough to attack such an enemy. This is what Sburb provides. Pretty convenient, huh. Once the king is defeated, this same lily pad changes color and serves as the platform for the gateway to claim the reward. See the panel on the right. This platform serves as the environment for a lot of endgame material toward the close of the story. But not material of a combat nature-more like social endgame stuff, where a  bunch of estranged kids finally get together, lounge around on the floor, and BS with each other.", "notes": null}]
