Very handy to know. Doesn't even have to be a prince, or a princess, or royalty of any kind. Can be literally any coplayer who, within the vaguely allotted time limit in which this reviving method is still valid, makes it to the body to kiss it. Feferi knows this how? Not sure I could tell you. Could be lots of ways, really. Maybe GI'bgolybsprite  told her offscreen, and she hurried away to do it? Or maybe she didn't actually know at all, and she just wanted to enthusiastically kiss Sollux's dead body? She is ~EXCIT-ED after all. The answer can be whichever explanation you think is more \"fun.\"", "notes": null}]
