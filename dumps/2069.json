[{"id": 2069, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The fact that Karkat's \"strife\" battle is being shown only now is a good window into the pacing logic of Hivebent, as an expression of \"what information and lore to reveal  when\" as opposed to \"what specific events happen, in what order.\" It also helps indicate that a linear procession through Karkat's early-game events just isn't how we're doing this, and the duel with his guardian (custodian) therefore doesn't have the same narrative weight or meaning that John's clash with his dad had. But aside from  pointing that out, this is quite a load of worldbuilding here. The fact that these kids are \"raised\" by alien beasts is just the right combo of dumb, funny, and genuinely intriguing from a worldbuilding standpoint.", "notes": null}]
