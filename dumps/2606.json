She suggests the scratch doesn't directly affect their session (true), that the scratch led a powerful demon to come to their session (true), and insinuates that the demon is Lord English (false, it's Jack), and that this chain of events forced English to emerge (semi-true, in that the Great Undoing, caused by Jack, is what ultimately summons English). All of this is a garble of half-truths and selective omissions. On that note, take a look at who she's talking to there. It's Doc. Looks like he's been putting ideas in her head (without \"technically lying,\" of course), and then she's been putting ideas in our heads. His text says \"particular instantiation. It's not any of my business.\" He's talking about the instantiation of Jack, who just arrived to mess everything up. Doc's right-Bec Noir is not his business. That particular Noir is from the human session, which is well outside Doc's jurisdiction. (Even though he still messes with the session later, by talking  to Rose.)", "notes": null}]
