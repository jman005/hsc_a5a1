[{"id": 2438, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Eridan at one point had a cool, mobile, pirate ship hive, which he probably cruised around the sea in during his Flarp games. Apparently at a later point it got shipwrecked on an island, and he never actually did anything about it, or simply wasn't able to. Which is probably fine. A hive is a hive. The only really bothersome thing to me about it is the fact that it's slightly non-level now. Probably annoying to live in a place like that. If he drops something round, does it go rolling downhill across the floor?", "notes": null}]
