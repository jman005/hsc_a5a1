Since I just make this shit up, I get to say what's true or not, but it does seem unlikely that they would get much bigger than that. (Sorry, the forty-eight-player Squiddle session was some bullshit joke and was never real.) It just doesn't seem logistically viable for many more players to play this game than that. But a twelve-player session would still ordinarily just have one set of ruins: a single frog temple with twelve surrounding planet-towers. This one is a special bifurcated session, though, as it says there. That means it has one usual set of ruins, which always end up next to the Forge. (The volcano there. All sessions start with one of those, except void sessions.) And also that the future site for one of the player's homes is nearby, like Jade, Kanaya, or Jake. But the underground Rogue Ruins site is quite anomalous to a session's starting planet. It makes sense that it's underground, hidden from view, and associated", "notes": null}]
