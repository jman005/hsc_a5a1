[{"id": 2272, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "I'd say landing on the one roll out of seventeen million possibilities which specifically summons a huge guillotine, when your objective is to put a giant spider out of its misery, actually qualifies as a very lucky roll. Will she appreciate this fact? Probably not. When you get it in your head that you're snakebit, you always focus on the bad, never the good, like when you fortuitously stumble on a very convenient way of euthanizing your horrible mother.\n\nSince these dice belonged to Mindfang at one point, it's reasonable to ask: did she have to guillotine her own spider mom too? Maybe it's becoming a Serket family tradition, like so many other things. Later on, when we learn more about ancestors, it seems like their spirits watch over their descendants and guide them in certain karmic ways, even if this phenomenon isn't quite that literal. They seem more like \"echoes of legend\" built into the kids' destinies. Maybe it's not \"luck\" that lets her roll results of certain importance to her life. Maybe Mindfang's spirit still presides over these dice.", "notes": null}]
