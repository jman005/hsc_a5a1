[{"id": 2092, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Is this the first use of the \"already here\" refrain for Lord English? I don't remember if it came up in the Intermission. Anyway, here it is again, if so. Maybe the CATCHPHRASE ITSELF was already here? Maybe it's always been here. The very concept of already being here was already here, and always will be already here. That baloney notwithstanding: the text above refers to English as a demon, but we're not stupid. We recognize the pool ball motif from the Intermission, so we immediately perceive this as being in reference to the summoning of Lord English. Just dragging more bits of lore from the Intermission into the main narrative, thus making it incrementally less irrelevant than we once foolishly assumed.", "notes": null}]
