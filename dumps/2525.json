[{"id": 2525, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "While Sollux has the worst land, Terezi has one of the better ones. She's a Mind player, and so she has these trippy, pulsing synapses covering the sky. The synapses aren't just decorative; they seem to be active constructs relating to the aspect of Mind and are used that way graphically later on when she starts dabbling with her powers. They're actually somewhat similar to the clouds in Skaia. But while those clouds are windows into future or past events in Paradox Space, conveying \"what you are seeing will happen, or has already happened,\" the synapses are windows into the many potential events and their offshoots in Paradox Space, conveying \"what you are seeing could happen,\" and it's up to a Mind player to sift through those possibilities as they become more adept with their powers.", "notes": null}]
