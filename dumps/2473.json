The tense final moments of getting the last player in the session (Sollux) involved his race against the clock to get Feferi in before she died, and Karkat's race to get Sollux in before her lusus released the Vast Glub in its dying gesture to protect her from a meteor. It's been noted that, due to the fact that the psychic Glub takes some time to travel through space to wherever the Condesce's ship is, this means Sollux actually died before his own ancestor (the Helmsman) did.", "notes": null}]
