She talks about a gift she has in store, only from her, no one else. (She \"commissions\" Equius to make Aradia a robot body, wants all the credit for the favor, and has no concern for the fact that he may have his own agenda for doing this. Of her many irons in the fire, some tend to be outsourced like this. In her self-obsession, she demands full credit nonetheless and expects to maximize the return on the investment she didn't even make, which is full amnesty for her past crimes.) Everything about what's happening here is wildly overcompensatory, meant to repair damage she's done without really having to face what it is she actually did. Aradia's extremely passive nature as a ghost makes her an easy target for this kind of overbearing attention. Because what Vriska seems to want most is acknowledgement, and more importantly, to foster strong reactions. Good or bad, love or hatred, this seems to be what she demands from everyone. -->", "notes": null}]
