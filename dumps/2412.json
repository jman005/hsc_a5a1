[{"id": 2412, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Eridan's loyal mount is seahorse dad, one of the objectively best dads, probably. Seahorse dad flies, as do apparently many, if not all, lusii meant to raise violet-blooded trolls. The Aquarius sign is the basis for Eridan's core concept as a troll. It's a slightly confusing sign, due to a couple superficial details. First, the name has the root \"aqua,\" which obviously evokes the idea of water. It's also right next to Pisces, the damn fish sign, and these two facts together clearly form the basis for the idea that the two highest blood types belong to an aristocratic sea dweller class. There's just one problem, though. Aquarius is actually an ATR sign. I know, it doesn't make much sense. Those zig-zaggy lines on Eridan's shirt? That's just some air blowing, I guess. It felt important to adapt vilet-blood themes a little to reflect this, a compromise", "notes": null}]
