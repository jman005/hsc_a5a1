It's also transparently ridiculous. But these are ridiculous kids who barely have a handle on what the hell they're actually doing when it comes to amorous activity. Even though the troll kids are technically the same age as the humans (albeit in different time units), it's still hard to imagine the humans doing anything like this until a few more years have time-skipped by (see: Act 6). It's fair to say trolls are just forced to grow up faster. A more violent, brutal culture, more self-sufficient upbringing without adult influence, a society revolving around more intense romantic conventions, and a forced breeding program mandated by the government. Factors like this are liable to encourage kids to start acting a lot older than they are.", "notes": null}]
