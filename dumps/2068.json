I probably put a couple character teasers like this in a row because in the previous conversation, Terezi rattled off a bunch of abbreviations, like AA, CA, AG... It seemed like a good idea to start dropping some more concrete visual cues associated with some of these unrevealed characters, to keep them in our minds and help us track who's left to reveal. Twelve characters is quite a lot to introduce in rapid succession. There's an art to doing it in a way that is interesting and makes them all feel distinct from each other,  and important in their own ways. Hivebent, for all the things maybe it isn't, totally NAILS being a fun character-rollout arc, IN MY VIEW. Anyway, back to the past, because we weren't done with it yet.", "notes": null}]
