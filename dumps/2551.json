[{"id": 2551, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The Midnight Crew as exiles for trolls serve widely varying roles for their players, supporting or antagonistic, parental or friendly. Heart Boxcars just wants to be Tavros's overbearing, thuggish wingman. Really wants him to go for that kiss. It makes sense that he wants to help Tavros out with his red quadrant, since HB is the heart-suited member of the gang. I'm sure I considered having all exiles work this way, but it doesn't end up being that literal, because, ehhh. It probably felt not worth shoehorning  in a precise one-to-one correlation where HB would help his kid with redrom, SS with blackrom, etc. Their influence is looser than that. SS goes on about how much he hates all these kids, and CD tries to be vaguely conciliatory toward Sollux. Close enough.", "notes": null}]
