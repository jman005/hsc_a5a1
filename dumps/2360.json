Which to the casual observer may read as hate. \"Why did the author hate this character so much?\" is a question some ask of fiction that is harsh to its occupants. It isn't \"true hate,\" but something else, a necessary degree of authorial viciousness to produce the right kinds of tension, which is tempered and balanced by an opposite force, authorial affection for a creation, which can express itself in extremes too, like various kinds of indulgence. These forces are explored symbolically in a more coherent sense later, but I think the themes begin to develop as Vriska's portrait comes into better focus, as a vessel for this particular kind of scorn, one obsessed with challenging others in cruel ways to force them to overcome their limitations and get stronger. As the \"most favored character,\" it makes sense that she would echo this authorial attitude. In fact, she by definition only inherits favored status in the first place because she's doing the dirty work for me, stirring the pot, pushing the buttons, raising the stakes. -->", "notes": null}]
