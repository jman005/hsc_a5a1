[{"id": 2493, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "That's the wolf from The NeverEnding Story. It's my greatest fear. I'm trapped in this attic like the kid from The NeverEnding Story was. That kid was reading a long fantasy story in that attic as a framing device for the \"real story,\" where a bunch of crazy stuff happened, and a sad horse drowned in a swamp at some point. Also, as the kid kept reading, the lines between the fiction and reality started blurring, so it was a similar kind of metaclusterfuck as Homestuck. (Well, not really, but whatever.) Except the guy in the attic in this case isn't reading the story that's coming to life and consuming his reality, he's writing it, while throwing a big tantrum, and screaming at a wolf-head trophy. So that's why The NeverEnding Story is a pretty apt \"mascot movie\" for the author-insert layer of Homestuck, which also does an incredible job of making the reader suspect that its story quite possibly will never end. The NeverEnding Story themes have a way of surfacing any time I show up in Homestuck. (E.q. the next time you see me, I'll be riding the huge, long, magic dog named Falcor, chasing cruel bullies, and punishing them for their evil deeds.)", "notes": null}]
