[{"id": 2190, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Equius demanding that Nepeta be on the blue team now makes a little more sense. (Aside from the fact it's probably what he wanted anyway as a controlling asshole, but still.) He knew she needed to function as Aradia's server player, while he was busy functioning as Aradia's client. I guess in Aradia's estimation Nepeta was among the least likely to make a big deal about Aradia's ghost status, and she's the confidante of Equius, who also knows. Here we also zip to the future to check out Aradia's land, and learn of her Maid of Time designation. Quartz and Melody correlate with her Time aspect. Quartz is used in clocks. As for melody, there are giant music box pieces everywhere, probably always turning their great brass columns, churning out creepy melodies that reverberate throughout the land. There's a little music box in her hive ruins there, which she's probably had for a long time. A little clue about destiny for her younger self to consider.", "notes": null}]
