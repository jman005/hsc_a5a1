That's why this frog puzzle feels like kind of a background joke rather than anything that could possibly matter to the story. I'm making sure the reader is always being reminded that the substance of the quest, which normally would be THE quest and explicit focus of such stories, is just a farcical backdrop to the actual foreground story. Which is about kids bullshitting with each other, the focus on their characters and themes, and the struggles along the way of their coming-of-age journey. The \"Quest,\" and later the \"Narrative Itself\" simply serve as convoluted, hostile, and usually satirical environments for that journey. They are analogues for life itself, or the hostile world we must grow up in, full of the many absurd and pointless quest-like regimentations of society. Vriska here again functions as a sort of mouthpiece for authorial scorn toward elements of his creation. She derides these puzzles as a boring and useless expenditure of her time and interest, as well as the reader's. But this expression of scorn is just an accurate observation about the story itself. The story isn't about this stuff, and her inclination to hack or cheat her way through Sburb is actually an insightful reflection of the priorities and logic of Homestuck.", "notes": null}]
