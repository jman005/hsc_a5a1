It was one of the legendary weapons the bunny had. So now we have another one of these little threads to follow, connecting the past to the future. We know this weapon makes a journey from this session to the human session, and into the \"future\" (or wherever Jade's penpal is), and then back again via the bunny box. Let's all check off the \"where that gaudy blue rifle in  the bunny box came from\" box on our scorecard. (I guess I should note that we saw it even earlier than this, when Eridan was riding the seahorse, but I delayed mentioning it until now, for Reasons.)", "notes": null}]
