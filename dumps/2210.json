[{"id": 2210, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Fakeout-delaying Equius's intro until now was a pretty good move, since it allowed for this nice external transition shot between two neighboring hives. Not bad. Here's a totally nuts fact: the retconned oil isn't on the poster anymore. It was in the first shot we cut away from, but now it's gone. How does the retconned oil work? Does  it stay there permanently, or does it exist fleetingly in the one panel it's shown in? This opens up some nasty metaphysical questions. By retconning something back into any given moment in the story, is it being retconned into the true stream of events, with the panel simply displaying the single moment we are viewing? Or is it being retconned back into a specific panel, which should be seen as a narrative construct in and of itself, not merely an abstract viewport which has no acknowledgeable identity? It's too early for this shit, friends. We're still crawling through some very dense, humorous alien lore here. We need to steel ourselves a lot more before we grapple with the metafictional bullshittery of late Act 6.", "notes": null}]
