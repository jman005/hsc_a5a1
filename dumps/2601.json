[{"id": 2601, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "For some reason, the doorknob to a new universe is very special. I mean, it makes sense. If you've got a door leading to a whole brand-new universe, you spring for a little something extra. Like some sort of sick orb you might buy in a new age store. Also crackling with mysterious wizard energy. This is the same basic shot used when John reaches for the knob at the end too. This same visual asset is used (but rotated ninety degrees) when John reaches into the house-shaped juju to get his retcon powers. These gestures have some cosmic gravity, and there's a purpose in echoing them. That knob asset is also used as the go-to graphic for dream bubbles. These are some INCREDIBLE facts I'm tossing out here, guys. Oh, here's a detail worth noting. We see Vriska back there, with her healed eye. This kind of spoils the fact that the beatdown she got from Aradia actually did kill her, rather than just wound her, and she gets resurrected in some way soon after. (We can only assume by a kiss, since we don't know about god tier yet.) Otherwise she'd still only have one eye.", "notes": null}]
