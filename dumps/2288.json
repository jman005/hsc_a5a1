Do you love me yet?\" I think we already established him as a creep, and this sure is a creepy thing to do. But it isn't much different than giving someone a love potion from a fantasy story, which in my observation, is not classically treated as an incredibly disturbing violation of another person's rights. Often love potions are used in a comical way, instead of presenting it as the monstrous feat of a sexual predator. At least the way he built the bot allows her to quickly remove the source of the invasive feelings if she found them disturbing. So there, that's my valiant defense of my sweet son, Equius. He's slightly better than the shitty rapists in stories who use love potions to win the affection of others.", "notes": null}]
