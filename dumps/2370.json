[{"id": 2370, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "to parse it this way, I think again due to being so well-trained to view stories on such moralistic terms, where rewards come to those who do things the right way, and punishment to those who don't. Characters themselves are motivated to see things this way too, because they, like us, cut their teeth on tales with such morals. So Karkat, and many other characters, are prone to evaluating what happens to them in the terms of \"the way stories typically work,\" which actually is a faulty perspective, verging on being tragic. The only conclusion to draw then, I believe, is this: it's wrong to interpret their misfortune after victory as punishment for either their moral failings or their approach to playing the game. A take I saw fairly often went something like, \"The trolls speedran the game, skipping over important challenges that were key to their personal growth, which led to their downfall.\" This is a misleading and superficial spin on what happened. It gives too much credit and authority to Sburb's various regimentations as legitimate authenticators of one's \"personal growth.\" They are not. Sburb has never been what it appears to be. Not to the players, and not to us.", "notes": null}]
