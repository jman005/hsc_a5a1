Of course he's reading some of his porn while watching the teen alien girls fight to the death, like some sort of weirdo. Actually I just put the paper in his hand to remind us of his affection for gray ladies, when he is in fact the exile for Aradiabot, who is...a gray lady. How perfect is this? I mean,  yeah, all trolls are gray, even when they're not robots. Just, give me a break, okay? Does this mean DD is using this device to creep on all the troll girls? He's coming dangerously close to horning in on Doc's act.", "notes": null}]
