[{"id": 2574, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Here's a Significant Moment. For Terezi personally, at least. So much so that she wrote the word MOM3NT with her own blood on a scarf to help John retcon back to this part of the story to make sure she doesn't waste any more of her life on this dumb boy. Normally on this page you'd be able to click on an alternate command labeled \"2222222\", which takes you to a password page. If you don't know the password, you just wonder what the hell is up with that, click back, and keep reading. Thousands of pages later though, you learn the password from the scarf, go back, enter the password, and proceed through an offshoot of the story involving John's ridiculous intervention. Nice use of the medium, right? Too bad it doesn't translate to a book at all, in any conceivable way, so it wasn't even worth considering how to do it. But hey, at least I EXPLAINED it down here. You know what they say. An explanation is worth 1,000 words. This one here is worth 183, so you're getting it for cheap.", "notes": null}]
