But there's a bit of transitional stuff to take a look at first, like this. Post- Descend felt like a good time to retire this particular conceit. The idea originally was, I think, to check back on this walkthrough document as Rose updated it, and learn more about the game as she learns. But clearly the game is way off the rails now, so there's not much point in such a linear transcription effort. Also, she's getting moodier, edgier, and tiptoeing ever closer to full-blown grimdarkness. I think 1 Corinthians 13 put it best: \"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a  child, I thought as a child; but when I became a woman, I put away childish things, such as my prolix, ridiculously overblown GameFAQs walkthrough project.\"\n\nWe probably all agree that etching vour initials with extravaaant lettering into the diaital canvas of vour walkthrough file using *DARK MAGIC\u00ae is a pretty Teen-Dramatic thing to do. But you at least have to admit that this signature is pretty cool regardless of the context.\n\nThis walkthrough page was actually just one really tall GIF image. We've been scrolling down gradually to reveal just how edgy Rose has become. Bear with us folks, we're making a book here. Bringing you content made for twenty-first-century technology DIRECTLY into a fifteenth-century format.\n\nWe're still scrolling. Here are some space monsters.\n\n", "notes": null}]
