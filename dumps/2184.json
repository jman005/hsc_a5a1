Oh, it's Feferi, got it. The master of subtlety is  at work yet again. She's a sea princess, but we'll get into her stuff later. Hivebent is very busy, as you know. It's way too busy to settle on any one thing, without suddenly switching to the next set of things it needs to hurry through. The next thing in this case is tuning into Aradia riding her big, cool frog head. Returning to her house is important, because you need a house to play this game. Also, bringing back the frog head is important, because...it just is. She'll need that soon, in a very consequential way.", "notes": null}]
