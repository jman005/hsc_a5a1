[{"commentary": "Equius has a few things in common with Vriska. Not a lot, but enough to be worth noting. Though Equius is a notch higher on the hemospectrum, they're both blue- blooded aristocracy whose castes maintain both deep contempt for those lower and (especially in indigo cases) exceedingly high regard for those above. The fact that they're neighbors suggests there isn't that big a divide between blue and indigo in terms of status and daily life. Both classes probably cluster together somewhat in a kind of snobby symbiosis, since they're one notch below purple-blooded clown hell, which is a radically different kind of cultural aristocracy. And both are one notch above the jade and teal middling classes, which enjoy some status, but both castes revolve around more functional, municipal services such as breeding administration and law enforcement. But on just a character level, there are a couple echos here. Vriska obsessively breaks 8-balls in a way \\"bordering on fetishistic.\\" Equius does the same with bows. Both for different reasons. For her, relating to her obsession and frustration with her luck. For him, obsession and frustration with his strength, something that he loves about himself but which prohibits him from doing another thing he loves. Fetishizing destruction and chaos for reasons along these lines is a theme that runs through this group, especially when you include Aradia's fixation on it as well.", "id": 2211, "page": "", "title": null, "notes": null}]
