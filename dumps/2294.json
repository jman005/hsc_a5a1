Maybe she was briefly even into the effect of the heart implant, in a sense? It certainly seemed to help jump-start her emotions again. Like some crazy emotional defibrillator. Just because the whole situation is creepy and weird and blood is everywhere doesn't mean we have to be a bunch of fucking downers and harsh too much on their strange little love story. Let's just be happy for them.", "notes": null}]
