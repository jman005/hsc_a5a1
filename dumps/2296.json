[{"id": 2296, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Karkat apologizes to himself, then accepts his own apology. A brief prelude to the many actual conversations (i.e. arguments) he has with past and future versions of himself. Nobody is better at having ridiculous, emotionally explosive, psychologically revealing conversations with himself than Karkat. Except maybe until Dirk comes along, who designed an entire AI version of himself for that very purpose. So maybe Dirk gets the prize? He doesn't yell as much though.\n\nKarkat really does have some amazing leadership skills. When Vriska tells him she got kicked off the blue team, his first order is to team her up with the guy she paralyzed, and still loathes. Then, when she objects, he goes on a long rant about everything that's wrong with her. Leader of the year??", "notes": null}]
