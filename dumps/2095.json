The way it works is, some authority (probably a bunch of drones or something) zones an area for these stems and builds a lot of them. They're completely blank edifices at first, but as lusii bring young trolls they've  recently united with from the caverns, they climb the stems and build new apartment-like hives clinging to the sides... Hey, Aradia's here. But there's no time to see what she's up to, because we need to whiplash to another scene change so we can be Kanaya.", "notes": null}]
