[{"id": 2090, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "All the trolls' custodians die and become their sprites. This was a swift way of learning a lot about how their session went. Much can be derived from this, including the fact that by the time all the trolls are in the session, the combined prototypings must result in a monstrous combination of features, and the black king they'd ultimately have to defeat would be an insane freakshow of an end boss. It also suggests a lot of probably quite entertaining and heartfelt scenes we never get to see. Such as trolls reuniting with their dead lusii, and getting to speak to the mute parental monsters for the first time ever. Karkat + Crabdad was a tearjerker, no doubt. Same with  Terezi and her dragon, who she never met at all as the dragon egg remained unhatched during her lifetime. Tavros and Tinkerbull? Absolute waterworks, trust me. The only one that sucked was Gamzee's reunion with Goatdad. It was complete garbage.", "notes": null}]
