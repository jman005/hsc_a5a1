[{"id": 2031, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Terezi's typing quirk is basically leet-speak lite, where the only letter swaps are ATE -> 413. We've observed this already, since we've seen her babble often enough. So we already knew she gets the special distinction of being associated with Homestuck's flagship number, 413. We didn't know why, but here it explains they're numbers the blind prophets once used. Who are the prophets? Come to think of it, this is one of the minor questions which is never expanded on much later. Were they teal bloods, like her? Prophets suggest psychic abilities. Were they rust and yellow bloods, like Aradia and Sollux? Sollux goes blind at some point. Maybe the prophets were yellow bloods who who went blind the way Sollux did, and spoke with Terezi's quirk? Are we getting warmer? Sure, why not. Also, as long as we're piling on the trivia here: 4+1+3 = 7. Teal (Libra) is the seventh blood class, or zodiac sign. Scorpio is the eighth.", "notes": null}]
