[{"id": 2624, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Finally: here it is. It took getting halfway through Act 5 to finally figure out what Sburb actually does. It's a universe creation engine, or more specifically, a means of universal procreation, challenging young kids from planets with sentient life to either succeed or fail in the propagation of meaningful existence itself. It sort of ties  a bow on the heretofore seeming arbitrary zodiacal associations with the trolls. They must have been understood on some level by ancient Earth cultures to be the creators. Whether it's known who they were, or whether they were a bunch of jerky alien teens, is anyone's guess. But apparently someone in ancient times picked out a bunch of constellations and named them after the twelve signs of the creators. That's a wrap for Hivebent, a.k.a. Act 5 Act 1, which we didn't know counted as ASA1 until now. We didn't even know acts could DO stupid things like that, but now we do. The act has bifurcated itself into two acts, with two sets of curtains, one red, the other blue, just like the universes.", "notes": null}]
