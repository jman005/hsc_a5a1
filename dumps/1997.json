[{"id": 1997, "page": null, "title": null, "notes": null, "commentary": "Sleeping in a huge cocoon full of slime isn't the weirdest possible thing a teen alien could do. But it would be pretty weird if they did so fully clothed. Thankfully, it's implied here that Karkat's aggravated he got his clothes all slimy, which would suggest that it's not customary to jump in fully clothed. On the other hand, I don't know if there's any evidence after this which suggests that trolls take their clothes off before going to sleep? There's one instance I can recall where Terezi is sleeping in her slime while fully clothed. Maybe Terezi is just weird? She didn't have a lusus to teach her how to go to bed properly, after all.
