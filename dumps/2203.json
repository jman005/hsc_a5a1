[{"id": 2203, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "2oc Scratch is such a poweru! manipulator, he manipulates other skied manipulators to manipulate others on his behalf, In this case, he does most o his manipulation work on Vriska and Terezi, the Scourge Sister manipulation duo extraordinaire. He manipulates them to manipulate everyone else, and he also plays them off each other, all the while being very smug about it. It's probably easy to be such an incredible puppet master when you're omniscient, but he doesn't care. His whole act tends to be \"playing with his cards facing up\" as kind of a mindfuck power move, constantly signaling that \"I'm going to get you to do what I want you to do, without making any secret about what I'm doing.\" Or, \"I'm going to mislead you without technically lying, you're going to be able to tell that's what I'm doing, but there's still nothing you can do about it, and none of your objections matter.\" He's a fairly conventional devil figure in this way, as well as a nefarious alt-author, with the power to stand in for me, or subvert the narrative. These are his top-level qualities as a character and narrative device, which are explored much more intensively late in Act 5 during his story-hijack move. But there's an awful lot more to say about him than this. You'll see.", "notes": null}]
