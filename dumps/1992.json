[{"id": "001992", "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Homestuck's overarching nature is to be iteratively repetitive. To establish long-term patterns, reach critical moments, \"reset\" itself in some way or another, then start over and replay the entire pattern with some iterative transformations, evolutions, or deconstructions of those patterns. Launching into Hivebent is the first (of arguably only two) major plot resets that boot up again in this familiar introductory way: the protagonist standing in his or her bedroom, briefly described in this way, awaiting  a command from the \"player.\" Because we immediately recognize this introduction template as echoing the first page where John is introduced, that makes a strong basis for almost instantly laying it on thick with the alien worldbuilding bullshit. Respiteblock? That's a silly word for a bedroom. Wriggling day? Guess that's a birthday.  Six solar sweeps? That must be what they call years. Oh also, Earth doesn't exist yet? What? That's new information of some interest. Let's put that in our back pocket, along with stuffed Jade and the Fourth Wall, and then make a mental note to buy pants with bigger pockets.", "notes": null}]
