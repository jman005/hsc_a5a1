This is a little more direct, but I guess it was clever of Equius to leave the remote override chip in there. The fact that he's been able to directly control Vriska's arm all this time raises some questions, though. What else has he done with this ability? Do we even want to know?? What are the odds that on some level, she doesn't particularly mind the fact that he pulled this dubious shit on her during a medical crisis??? Do we want to know that either???? In any case, it's not too far off from what she herself has the ability to impose on some of her other friends. It wouldn't be a bad means of keeping her honest and preventing her from exploiting her own powers in creepy ways, if that's how he chose to use this leverage. Which it isn't, because he doesn't care.", "notes": null}]
