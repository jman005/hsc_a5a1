[{"id": 2392, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The origins of troll romance aren't that mysterious. The Midnight Crew Intermission, featuring a gang of mobsters related to the four card suits, was presented in proximity to a world of aliens we were about to meet. In fact, the Midnight Crew are the exiles for those alien players. The conceptual linkage between trolls and the four suits began there. The symbol for one suit, a heart, symbolizes romance for humans. The question following almost naturally after that, if you're just a little bit nuts, is: what if, in a different culture, the other three suits represent different kinds of romance? It's like an exponential expansion of the idea. One suit, a heart, is a 1A1 grid, singular, simplistic. One data point, which by itself implies no pattern. Whereas four suits expands the realm of romance geometrically, to 2A2, which is where the notion of a grid, or \"quadrants\" begins to take shape. And once we're talking about quadrants, further organizing principles present themselves. What do the red suits have in common? The black? How about similarity by shape? (The heart naturally corresponds to the spade, and therefore evokes its opposite.) Believe it or not,  this stuff actually does start designing itself. That's how you know the shit is real. It has the veneer of silly nonsense, but it's not. It was there all along, just waiting for someone to reveal it.", "notes": null}]
