They're actually more fundamental than physical laws, certain platonic concepts, or the aspects themselves. What's that? This is some of the dumbest shit I've ever said? Well, get outta here then. I'm gonna keep going with this. What sort of statement could I be making by asserting this truth? Hmm, let's see if I can make this shoe fit. Celebrities to us are bigger than just people, bigger than life actually. They're cultural touchstones. Like personified landmarks to let you know you haven't lost your bearings. To let you know you're still alive, here in  this culture, and no matter what stupid things happen, or what our differences may be, we will always have a mutual, universal understanding and recognition of who these clownish, mediocre famous people are, and there's some comfort in that. Comfort on par with the basic understanding that gravity will always behave as you understand. Apples always fall from trees, and even if they bonk you on the head, there's still comfort in the reminder of this constancy. There, did I just make this horseshit work for you? You know I just did. You're probably mad now.", "notes": null}]
