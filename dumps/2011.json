[{"id": 2011, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "With all that talk of Gamzee in the previous note, there was no space to give a shout-out to how he kept talking about his horns earlier on in the story. Asking Karkat to give them a squeeze, how he scared himself with them... Before seeing him, we had no idea he was referring to literal clown horns. So that was a pretty good quick-setup-and-deliver gag. Just saying! If I don't honk my own fucking horn, who will? Also, the end of this conversation establishes that his whole juggalo shtick is a religious thing, which is a very important detail. He's not a juggalo just because I thought it would be funny (which is still a major factor, to be fair). He promulgates this nonsense as an expression of a certain profoundly idiotic piety to the Mirthful Messiahs, whose specific identities morph over the course of the story depending on  context, and on whichever particular interpretation happens to be most convenient at any given moment, either to him, or me.", "notes": null}]
