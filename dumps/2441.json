Which is a shame, because it results in her being near the bottom rung in terms of overall screen tlme and word count among major characters. Them's the breaks, though. In a cast of 500, not everyone gets to be a superstar. Still, there are things about her worth examining and celebrating, so let's do that. Like Kanaya, who has the \"few of your kind\" refrain, Feferi has \"only of your kind,\" because it's literally true. There's one pink blood at a time on this world, except the Condesce, who's always out there somewhere. Her royal ambition seems to be to duplicate the conditions of peace on Beforus, possibly including the part where they care for the underprivileged to an extent that may be overbearing. Beforus, instead of having stratified brutal oppression, was more like a stratified nanny state. Feferi seems to display this inclination with her adoption of wildlife, which doesn't need caring for either. They're cared for because she wants it, not them, which is Beforus life in a nutshell. In this sense, the Alternia heiress (Feferi) and Beforus heiress (Meenah) possess reverse mentalities. Feferi craves the order and over-caring of Beforus, while Meenah craves the chaos and exploitation of Alternia (unsurprisingly, since she's the teen Condesce). -->  ida cin A l t cc cane cc A kcal te dec ies       dots", "notes": null}]
