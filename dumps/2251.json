All Aradia did was conjure a brief karmic spookfest to cause Vriska to directly  confront the souls of those she killed in the past. It almost isn't even a punishment. More like a cute idea. Responding by using Aradia's own \"boyfriend\" as a puppet to murder her is somewhat less cute. She ices the deal with another melodramatic one-liner. With Tavros, it was Troll Spanish. Now it's Troll Italian, I guess. Don't ask me why all these Troll Foreign Languages exist. Can't say I've got any answers there. Aradia's ancestor speaks Troll Japanese. Well, Troll Badly Google Translated Japanese.", "notes": null}]
