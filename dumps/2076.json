[{"id": 2076, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Okay, the previous page's note also contained way too much fucking meta. Let's tone it down, all right? Here's some frivolous shit. The troll names, as you probably know, were drawn from the reader suggestion box, which was only reopened during a troll intro like this. Usually I'd mix and match suggestions, like one person suggests Karkat, another suggests Vantas, and I decide to grab both and stick them together. In this case I think someone just suggested Pollux Castor, which is just the name of the Gemini star system. Which I thought was WAY too on the nose, but otherwise felt promising. So all I did was rearrange the letters a bit. Here's yet more frivolity. Some speculated that Sollux is secretly a reference to every Nic Cage movie ever made. Note the bees (see: Wicker Man, when Cage humorously gets his head swarmed with bees), and the code on walls circled with red and blue (see: Cage in Knowing), and Sollux's ability to foresee doom in the future (see: Cage in Next), NOT TO MENTION Castor and Pollux were the names of Cage and his younger brother in Face/Off... The list probably goes on.", "notes": null}]
