What's Equius doing here, anyway? Looks  like his robo-girifriend ditched him already, leaving him to start planet-hopping and unite with his dear moirail. As spicy as that moment was between Aradiabot and Equius, after that it's implied there wasn't much depth to the relationship. Just kind of a weird fling. Much later, in one of the dream bubble mini-sprite games I believe, Aradiabot gives the impression that after their fling, she just kind of saw him as a gross dude she vaguely regretted letting anywhere near her long after that.", "notes": null}]
