[{"id": 2186, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "It's not accidental that we're watching Aradia return to the ruins of her old home, in a way that's interwoven with the Flarp disaster backstory. We're methodically exposing pieces of the puzzle to reveal what happened overall, which includes showing traces of the aftermath. We now know that whatever happened to Aradia during this Team Charge/Team Scourge blowup probably resulted in the destruction of her home. She's Ok with that, though. Also, this narration is pretty cagey. It says she has an arrangement to be co-leader with a blue blood but doesn't say which one. We just saw Vriska bragging about such an arrangement with her, but  it could also be Equius (it is, in fact, Equius). But even then, Aradia's only using him, too. She's playing everyone. She has a very advanced and pragmatic view of leadership when it comes to a Sburb session. She understands there's no such thing as a leader, just a bunch of sad kids getting played by Paradox Space. In a way,  she's the most honest type of leader any session has. A leader by absentia, a cold orchestrator of preordained, controlled chaos, who creates the spaces for all the pieces to fall into place, and then just sits back and lets them fall.", "notes": null}]
