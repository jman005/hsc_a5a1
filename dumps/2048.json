[{"id": 2048, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "First: another floating arm sighting. Do you see it?? On the coin flip: this is both the first instance of flipping this coin to determine someone's fate, as well as the first time that the result of the coin flip didn't actually matter that much. In this case, a favorable result for the victim, resulting in his death regardless. In the case much later, basically the opposite (followed by a do-over fueled by Seer of Mind powers). There's a theme being established here. Not gonna launch into it too hard, but it concerns the subject of luck, either its irrelevance or subversion in situations where Terezi is concerned, and later, how that specifically ties into her relationship with a certain Scourge Sister who I won't bother mentioning for now.", "notes": null}]
