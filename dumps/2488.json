Who the fuck are we kidding. Everything holds up well. Timeless, perfect literature, that's the shit I'm about, and nothing else. Got it? This material is revisiting the idea that I only appear through these little meta-media transitional devices involving Jack, who's inextricably associated with the Fourth Wall construct, as the disgruntled bureaucrat who worked in a cubicle consisting of four such walls utilized as monitoring devices in his nefarious, day-to-day grind. And now we see some things never change for him. He's still watching things he hates playing out on screens, and having no choice about it, kind of like you. And we pull the frame back a little and see that I'm pretty  much in the same boat. We're all stuck in this hell together. But as the only tortured genius among us all, I'm the only one who's allowed to have funny meltdowns about it.", "notes": null}]
