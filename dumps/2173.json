Something about her quirk to point out: she obviously replaces \"ate\" sounds in words with \"8.\" But sometimes I made judgment calls on how literal to be about this. Like \"blatant\" should technically be spelled But omitting the middle \"t\" feels like it hurts readability a little too much. \"8l8tant\" helps the eye pick up what word it's supposed to be more easily. I didn't do this with every word though, just the ones that bugged me.", "notes": null}]
