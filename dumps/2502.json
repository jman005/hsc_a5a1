[{"id": 2502, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Maybe this joke loses something here. Because we (rightly, I think) decided to forgo using the ==> symbols in the books to advance to the next panel, to reduce clutter. After Hivebent began, the ==> symbol became = ==>. The first one is a house-like shape, representing four players. The second represents twelve. The standard format keyboard only comes with the ==> button. Which is completely useless when it comes to Jack trying to advance the \"story.\" So he has to kind of hack it, to his frustration. This isn't the only time I frustrate villain characters with badly designed interface constructs meant for viewing story events. The stunts I pull with Caliborn's viewing device are a masterstroke in author-on-OC antagonism. Of course, it's critical that I do this. Somebody needs to train the supreme villain  in his evil ways. It might as well be the author.", "notes": null}]
