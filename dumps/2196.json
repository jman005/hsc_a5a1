Since serving as the ultimate troll, fandom wedge, and escalator of drama is an inseparable part of her profile, by extension the narrative has a way of constantly dragging her back into the spotlight to keep stirring the pot, ratchet up controversy, and continue forcing the plot forward by dint of her overbearing personality and need to be important. Whether she's the one forcing her way back into the spotlight all the time due to ego, or it's actually the narrative always pulling her back in as a preferred tool of effective melodrama, thus giving her a reputation as someone favored by the author as a vehicle for mayhem and controversy, is left for readers to decide. It's also left for them to decide if there's even a difference between those things. But one consequence of this blatantly evident favoritism she either enjoys or steals from the narrative is that, after enough time goes by, it becomes an indisputable point of fact that, without caveat, excuse, or even the slightest attempt at conveying any sense of shame about the development,", "notes": null}]
