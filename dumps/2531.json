[{"id": 2531, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "We already know that the queen exiles talk in this font, because the White Queen talked that way to Rose. So we definitely know who this is. This makes the Black Queen officially the exile for both Vriska and Terezi, which I think we can agree is a pretty good matchup. Terezi using her chalk here to communicate with her exile is a nice way to handle this scene so that the reader can observe their interaction. It does raise a question, though: why couldn't Terezi just answer the Queen verbally? Surely there's audio in those stations. I think the best answer is that Terezi just likes any excuse she can to use her chalk.", "notes": null}]
