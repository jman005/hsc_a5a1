[{"id": 2570, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "We've come to anticipate the \"Rift\" in the troll session, which has been alluded to. Some vague, calamitous event, which we know literally nothing else about. So when Kanaya scrolls up, we can surmise the jagged tear at the top of the timeline window signals this event. It doesn't, though. The Rift is just a term Karkat used to describe an event he didn't understand, which was Jack showing up and slicing their entryway into the new universe in half. He guessed some vague rift in space-time was responsible for that. The jagged rip in the timeline window is something else completely. If you read Problem Sleuth, that rip might look familiar. The underlying graphic and style of that Jagged edge were copied from the moment when the entire universe ripped in half, and then needed to be sewn back together with a big needle. There's a reason I copied that exact graphic over for this purpose. The cataclysmic nature of the two events turns out to be pretty similar.", "notes": null}]
