[{"id": 2007, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "--> So when Karkat is impatient with and aggravated by these storytelling patterns-the various linguistic tics, beats, and refrains we now recognize as idiomatic  to Homestuck-he's actually being impatient with life itself, as defined in this metatextual way. Resisting and subverting the various traditions and orthodoxies that Homestuck has established as integral to its own telling is the same as resisting and subverting the organic flow of one's own journey through life and personal growth. This idea gets hit pretty hard in Act 6, unavoidably, since the conceit of Act 6 is an even more explicit and unequivocal rebooting of the narrative for a more thoroughly deconstructive reprisal of Homestuck. Wait, was this way too much fucking meta to drop under this funny Karkat monologue? Maybe it was. I'M KEEPING IT THOUGH.", "notes": null}]
