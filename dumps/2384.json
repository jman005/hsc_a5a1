[{"id": 2384, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Out of frustration, she briefly considers taking this route, but bails on the idea quickly. She's a lot of things, but this is one thing she apparently isn't. (Hint: it's a thing that begins with \"rape\" and ends with \"-ist.\") But her ancestor was. Spending centuries being a swaggering asshole pirate emboldens one toward certain unseemly behaviors, I guess. Vriska idolizes her ancestor of course, and models much of her personality and bravado after her, or at least her impression of who she was. Basically, she's a bad influence. As if having one bad mom wasn't enough, in a way Vriska actually has two. The Mindfang diaries... Oof, there's some shit to unpack. We'll get to that next book. Learning about Mindfang's life as told through her journal, and knowing that Vriska read every page while very young, tells us a lot about why Vriska is who she is. Perhaps more importantly, seeing differences in the ways she wants to be like Mindfang, but can't quite bring herself to be, might actually tell us more about Vriska than how she strives to be similar.", "notes": null}]
