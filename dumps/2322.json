[{"id": 2322, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "We finally meet Kanaya. On book page 271. That's actually a long way to go before finally meeting a major troll we already knew about. She's third to last, in fact, just behind the two sea dwellers. But there's good reason for holding off on her introduction. Her living situation is very unusual by troll standards. She basically just lives  in Jade's house, with her own personal touches strewn about. She, like Jade, has sort of a combo-breaking quality in the stream of character introductions. The nine previous to her grew up in situations that were typical for trolls within their classes, so introducing them doubled as a good way to get to know troll culture. Now that we have some context, we can start identifying departures from those norms. Leaving the sea dwellers for last also fits in with this reasoning. It's hard to appreciate what it means to be aristocratic until it's understood what it means to be common. Saving these three for last is part of that overall design and is also why, in her intro, Kanaya quickly starts talking to Eridan and Feferi. So we can finally hear their voices and set up their imminent introductions.", "notes": null}]
