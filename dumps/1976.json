It's a big broken egg, because the station shape is related to the entry object of the player who lived there-in this case, Dave, who had to wait for an egg to hatch to enter the session. Notice how the egg station is  broken in half. Remember how Bro had to chop the meteor in half to buy Dave some time? That's why. Splitting the meteor also split the station it contained. Now WQ has discovered it and must repair it to make it functional."}]
