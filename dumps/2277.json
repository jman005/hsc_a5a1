[{"id": 2277, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Vriska has a few really, really epic meltdowns throughout Homestuck, right up to the end. The meltdown to end them all of course happens between Vriska x (Vriska). These incidents always expose a deeply sad and broken person. I have no consoling remark to follow that up with. It's just how it is, folks. And now, the introduction to Equius's haunting land, already in progress. His hive is tilted, which is just the way it came in. He'll probably have to fix that at some point (don't worry, he's STRONG enough to just push it back, probably). Silence is the operative idea for his aspect of Void. A void of sound. His land actually is pretty reminiscent of the Alpha Kid session planets (which makes sense, since it's a void session). They're all planets full of tombs, crypts, etc., each conveying a profoundly haunting, solitary vibe. I always felt, on a totally personal level, that it's one of the nicer details of Act 6. The lands all have an extremely evocative sense of desolate atmosphere.", "notes": null}]
