[{"id": 2314, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "We're leading up to another non-reveal reveal showing us how the \"two\" game sessions were actually one big, twelve-player session all along. There were many small clues along the way, including the shot a few pages ago of the queen's ring with twelve orbs, and the story treats this fact as so obvious to everyone that it's presented in the form of a somewhat humorous confirmation rather than a mind-blowing revelation. This happens often enough in Hivebent that this casual reveal method almost starts feeling like a refrain, which probably results more from this arc's fast and loose pacing than anything else. As if to say, we're in a big hurry here folks, we don't have TIME to have our minds blown. That said, let's admire these uncharacteristically detailed action panels exhibiting cool environments and teamwork. Wanna know something? Well, In My Opinion, those music box-tower things are particularly good fantasy set pieces. Nice concept, nice design. You agree with me.", "notes": null}]
