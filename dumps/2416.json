Anyway, Eridan's handle is caligulasAquarium, which could have brought a bunch of stuff to mind when we first saw it. The \"Aquarium\" part was the dead giveaway that he would be the Aquarius troll. An aquarium also evokes the idea of a whole menagerie of sea beasts, which maybe he tended to in some manner. And now, these panels here possibly indicate that his \"aquarium\" is really the sky, which he views as a sort of hunting grounds.", "notes": null}]
