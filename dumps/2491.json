We first met him in Problem Sleuth, when the final boss revealed he had a million more health meters. But he originated in Jailbreak, the first MSPA comic, as a guy who, upon breaking out of jail, at some point became fixated on the idea of suicide in the proximity of this tree stump with a harpoon stuck in it. Don't go looking for Jailbreak, or read it, ever. It is the most cursed tale I have ever written in my life. We shouldn't even be talking about it. Nevertheless, I think this character makes for a great avatar for the reader in general. A long-suffering, walleyed individual who conveys a certain air of helplessness over the material he views, his struggle to understand it, and his complete impotence when it comes to halting his addiction to this content. Suicide is never far from his mind, and hardly a thing takes place on this website which does not in some way cause him to meditate upon the notion of ending it all. This being is your guiding spirit, and to deny this is to spew lies. He apparently hails from a stark and lonely planet called LOSAD.", "notes": null}]
