[{"id": 2603, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "So, I'll just come right out with it: Bec Noir transports here, slices the door in half, and they all escape to a meteor before he can kill them. Aradia calls it a \"rift\" too, like Karkat, and implies the human kids open this rift. They didn't, though. (However, they were basically responsible for the rise of Bec Noir, in many respects, so the transference of blame still largely stands.) The rift itself was caused by Noir, who deliberately teleported here via an exile station on Earth, to escape the imminent destruction of that universe (which he himself is the cause of, not long after he arrives here). Aradia says rifts are catalogued phenomena in the game itself, which really isn't wrong. It's simple transporter technology, so yeah, duh, it's all part of the game. But I can't be too hard on her. She's doing me, the author, a favor by  being enigmatic at this point in time. This stuff is all still super, duper mysterious right now. P.S. There's a John arm. It's right in front of Tavros's face. I wonder what he thinks about it.", "notes": null}]
