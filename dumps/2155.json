There are a lot of comic book hero things going on with the troll powers. I think this is obvious enough that it barely warrants mention, but here I am mentioning it, because someone bought ink by the barrel and gave the barrels to me to splash around with for 500 pages.

So let's get to know her, all right?", "notes": null}]
