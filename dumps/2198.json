[{"id": 2198, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "the many pieces that combine to form the constituents of what we call an arc. Her arc is an absolute whopper. Where to even begin surveying it? Some character ares are so big, it's probably better to view them as a series of phases or chapters, all of which thread together and relate to a few bigger ideas. The \"bad luck\" vs. \"good luck\" chapter of Vriska's arc is more of an Act 5 thing and becomes less relevant later. But for now, it's established that this bad luck streak started with the \"accident,\" which resulted in the maiming of all her friends and herself, and the death of Aradia. Even though there's something to the concept of luck in the story (she can use it as a power to get lucky rolls, etc.), I don't think you have to be a genius of literary analysis to detect that \"bad luck\" in this case is something of a scapegoat for her. More likely it's shorthand for a guilty conscience, and the bad karma associated with it. There's a hole in her soul, created by a life of misdeeds she won't face, and the struggles for success, treasure, victory, glory, and above all, relevance, are constant exertions throughout her very long journey in the vain and  mostly unsuccessful attempt to fill this moral vacuum inside her. In other words, it's an arc of ambition as a staggering gesture of overcompensation. Like Karkat on steroids. with much darker underivina pathos.", "notes": null}]
