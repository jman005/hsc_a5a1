[{"id": 2110, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "This, frankly, is a bit gross. How about we just kick off Tavros's intro with a ton of graphically unpleasant gooey alien shit? Why not. It also establishes his animal communion power, which, to be fair, is a pretty good justification for playing Fiduspawn, no matter how lame Vriska thinks it is. Could it be the game of choice for many brown bloods, who also happen to have this ability? No wonder she prefers to pull Tavros into a game that grants her powers a major advantage, rather than his. Wow, she is so smart.", "notes": null}]
