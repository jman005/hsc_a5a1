That's some of the rawest sadstuck you'll ever see. This struck me as a good moment to finally pivot to The Dump. It's been building. You could kind of feel it actually, even if you didn't know it was coming. Something *intense*, involving a closer look at what troll romance is all about. Flirting with these weird terms, characters making  advances on each other that involve different card suits... Something was up. Here's what's up. It's called TROLL ROMANCE, motherfuckers, and it's serious as shit. Read and study every word carefully. This is your life now.", "notes": null}]
