[{"id": 2401, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Fandom took troll romance suuuper seriously. I know, shocking, right? There was a lot to talk about and discuss, ways of applying it to other works of fiction, to their original work, and even to their lives. Which, bringing this into your real life, is probably getting a bit carried away. Not many people went totally off the deep end, trying to fill all four quadrants, or if they did, I never saw much of it. But I did notice that the one new quadrant which really took off, on a casual everyday life basis, was this one. Big portions of fandom would freely use the term moirail, and describe certain friends that way. I think plenty still do, actually.", "notes": null}]
