[{"id": 2374, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "This looks familiar, a Breath player rocket-crashing into a Light player's bedroom as she sleeps. John did that to Rose. But you remember that, why am I pointing it out? Can't you do ANYTHING for yourself? No, of course you can't. Your life would completely fall apart without me and my helpful notes, and we both know it. Anyway, unlike the John crash, this is obviously a rigged stunt. A spider trapping her chosen prey for a bit of fun and sexy roleplay. Arguably the funniest thing happening here, aside from the basic fact that Vriska had the idea to do this at all, is that it doesn't seem she really knows how the Peter/Pupa Pan story works.  Peter flies into Wendy's window, not Tinkerbell's. What's going on here is just a BIT dumb. She probably just wanted an excuse to dress up as a sexy fairy. Can you blame her???", "notes": null}]
