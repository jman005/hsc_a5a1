This must have been a hell of a find for her in that ghost ship. 8 dice, with 8 sides each. 8A8 makes for almost 17 million possible rolls. 8 obviously is Vriska's magic number, but 8-8 pairs have some ominous significance. In this story the 8-ball has grim associations with the destruction of a universe (see: Snowman). Two 8s is therefore associated with the destruction of two universes, which is a cosmically synchronous event with the summoning of Lord English. English is often shown with his pool ball eyes frozen in the grim 8-8 state, and this is in fact the state they lock to when confronted with Vriska moments before his presumable defeat. In that sense, it's a shorthand for \"game over.\" 88 is also associated with Hitler. The bad news for this number just keeps piling up. Also I have the same initials as Hitler. Okay, I'm getting a signal in this earpiece from my producer to stop talking about Hitler. But you get the idea. 8 is a cursed number, and double 8 is octuply bad.", "notes": null}]
