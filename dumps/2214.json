[{"id": 2214, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "when it came to rolling out tons of diverse, often ridiculous new characters. Primarily, 1 saw them as interesting challenges in writing and characterization. By the  very nature of trolls, a lot of these guys were always going to be pretty bad, obnoxious, gross, or creepy, particularly at first glance. So one major challenge I found interesting was something like, \"How do you introduce someone who appears to be almost instantly revolting or objectionable, and then proceed to make the reader love this person against all odds?\" Equius is probably the strongest example up to this point of me embracing this idea as a challenge. The initial impressions he  gives are pretty horrible. He's constantly angry, racist, humorless, has weird horse porn everywhere, and...oh no, does he BEAT HIS LUSUS TOO?? Just awful. But  the unfolding of his character thereafter reveals certain mitigating truths. He doesn't beat his lusus, he's just so strong he leaves bruises despite his best efforts at tenderness. It's like a disability he struggles with. If you want to go full sadstuck, picture him unable to hug his dear moirail upon meeting her, for fear of crushing her fragile bones. There are many small ways his portrait is guided so that a guy who really has no right to be seen as endearing ends up being strangely so, often in ways that aren't even easy to explain. 1 firmiv believe that if vou don't love Eauius after vou've read most of Homestuck. then there's something wrona with vou.", "notes": null}]
