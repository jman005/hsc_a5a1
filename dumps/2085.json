She cleared off the frog torso so she can have a nice, flat surface to stand on when I eventually introduce her. Since becoming a ghost, she has vacated her hive, so she doesn't have the traditional bedroom environment for an intro like everyone else. The desecrated temple must suffice.\n\nThis broad is a stone-cold bummer, folks. She knows many things in advance of the session, making her sort of the wet blanket Jade of the party (until Kanaya, the troll with jade blood, turns out to be an even Jadier Jade of the party). But instead of getting her visions from clouds, Aradia gets them from ghosts, who she can commune with. Also her foreknowledge of the session appears to be nearly exhaustive, including knowledge of their ultimate failure. Maybe if Jade knew her session was doomed from the start, she wouldn't be quite so chipper?? Aradia even understands their failure will \"briefly masquerade as victory,\" which is absolutely right.

Aradia unwittingly follows in her footsteps with stunts like this.", "notes": null}]
