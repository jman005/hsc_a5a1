The exile station is modeled after something related to the server player for the character the exile speaks to via console. For instance, WV, who was John's exile, was in a cork station on top of a big wine bottle, at the site of where Rose's house used to be. Never forget the rules. If you do, I'll just keep reminding you. In fact, I'll do that even if you don't.", "notes": null}]
