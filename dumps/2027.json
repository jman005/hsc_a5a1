[{"id": 2027, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "When getting to know the human kids, we never got anything resembling the backstory of how Sburb came to be, except for a few vague clues we could piece together. Like, it was developed by Skaianet, which had a lab behind Rose's house, which her mom worked in, and Mom was presumably in touch with Jade's grandpa, who habitually explored ruins, one of which may have contained Sburb's code. We have to make a lot of those leaps ourselves, though. In Hivebent, the narrative is pretty up-front about what happened: Aradia salvaged the code from the frog ruins, and Sollux adapted that code to run as an executable game. They're unambiguously responsible for bringing this upon their friends and their planet. Which makes a certain amount of sense, as they're the two characters who commune with the dead  of the future and the past.", "notes": null}]
