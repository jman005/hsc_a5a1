So I guess dead people in robot bodies can be double-doomed? Why not. Dead people in ghost bodies can double-die, after all. And finally, we see the meteor the trolls have been trapped on since we first met them in Act 4. It's worth remarking on this location, because it turns out to be pretty much the most lived-in setting of the entire story. More scenes take place here than anywhere else,  I'm pretty sure. Ranging from the troll group as it currently stands, to a ridiculous hodgepodge of trolls and humans over a three-year journey (played out twice), all the way to Calliope and Caliborn in a far-flung future setting.", "notes": null}]
