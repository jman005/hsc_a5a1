[{"id": 2002, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "As far as satirical programming languages go (which is a genre I invented, as far as I'm concerned), ~ATH is a pretty good one. It's pronounced \"til death\"; that's tilde + ath, for those keeping score at home. It's also not a bad \"mascot programming language\" for Homestuck itself, if you'd like to view it that way. A framework for labyrinthine logic based solely on interminable cyclical patterns, whose exits are predicated on the mortality of certain individuals, or even of the universe itself. Yep,  that checks out. The fact that the supreme embodiment of all evil behind everything that ever happens is set to be summoned upon the execution of a ~ATH script supports this idea as well.", "notes": null}]
