They clearly are programmed to understand on a primal level what's important from a gameplay perspective. This kid shouldn't be getting exiled back to Earth with AR. That would be a huge misfire in terms of the flow of the game's strategy and narrative. Dersites are technically the \"enemy\" and function as a threat to the heroes, but lower-level ones like this will probably make sacrifices to ensure the heroes don't actually leave the boundaries of the game itself."}]
