It never ends.) Sollux, like Nepeta, is another pretty marginal character, and also like her, his metatextual profile seems to acknowledge his marginality, and incorporates it into his personality in a thematically relevant way. He always seems to be falling into the margins of the story as a second-string player, gets used as a pawn a lot, gets led around by others (going blind at one point), and generally just can't catch a damn break. As a psychic, he's aware of things on a  lot of levels, such as future visions of doom and gloom, but he also seems intuitively aware of his place in the narrative as just a marginal cast member in a story containing people much more important than he is. His \"woe is me,\" \"why don't I just roll over and fucking die already\" attitude seems like it's connected to this basic awareness. In other words, his resigned sense of fatalism is inseparable from his narrative impotence, and the basic truth about him is that he was built to be little more than a serviceable part of a big machine. Just like his ancestor.", "notes": null}]
