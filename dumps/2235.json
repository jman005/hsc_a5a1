[{"id": 2235, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "I might say Equius does Vriska an accidental favor by killing her awful spider mom and freeing her from the slavery of feeding duties. Except what really happens here is that by killing her he's guaranteeing the spider will be prototyped, thus forcing Vriska to continue having to deal with her in the session but now being able to actually speak to her directly. I'm guessing they didn't really have many heart-to-heart talks, to put the bad blood behind them. Seems more likely it motivated Vriska to get out of the hive as much as possible and go treasure hunting on her cool map planet. Aurthour though, now that's a real tragedy. He and Equius probably had some truly amazing, tear-jerking conversations off screen.", "notes": null}]
