It's the arguable axis around which the whole epic revolves, when you really study all the ramifications from the fallout resulting from their rivalry, ensuing revenge cycle, and mutually floundering struggle for redemption, in the warped way each of them defines that idea. The \"truce\" they refer to here roughly covers the conditions surrounding their entire tandem arc. An uneasy agreement to set aside their vicious, competitive tendencies to allow for a stable friendship, even though the friendship seems entirely based on their deep need for these competitive behavior patterns to play themselves out. The truce in a sense is an acknowledgement of an unhealthy codependency, an addiction to the negative qualities and drama they bring out in each other and in everyone around them who gets pulled into it. And as we know from two blue blood intros already, addiction is a powerful thing.", "notes": null}]
