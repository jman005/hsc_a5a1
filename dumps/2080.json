[{"id": 2080, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The very common psychic power of being able to put things to sleep is established here. Pretty much any psychic can do this: Sollux, Aradia, Vriska... It happens  a lot, often with significant consequences. Note also the exact visual callback to when Dave was staring at the blood on his hands. Same panel, just recolored. For reasons that are never made especially clear, Sollux has certain things in common with Dave. Certain speech patterns, verbal echoes, coolguy with shades look, similar apartment building setup, and callbacks like this where he stares at honey (or blood) on his hands in a way that triggers rumination on certain traumas. But Sollux's  traumas are less related to a troubling guardian relationship, and more about the struggle with his own troubled brain. Particularly his bipolar issues, as well as the extreme and volatile mutant abilities he has, the most explosive of which are triggered by this honey.", "notes": null}]
