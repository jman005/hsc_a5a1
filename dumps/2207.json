[{"id": 2207, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "It's an amusing and easy to forget sidebar to Vriska that one of her hobbies is building doomsday devices. This one is for Eridan, obviously. Probably the funniest thing about it is the fact that it almost certainly won't ever work as intended-powerful enough to blow some stuff up, but never the whole world. She just made some empty promise to Eridan to get him to do something for her. There's virtually no way she's ever interacted with him without dunking on him in some manner. Another funny thing about it is the fact that getting help from one of her \"pals nearby\" (Equius) probably just means she made him do almost all of the work and is taking full credit for it, just like she's doing with Aradiabot. Additional trivia: this art asset is just the doomsday dice cascader from a Problem Sleuth bonus page. The fact that this asset already existed is probably just what gave me the idea to include it at all, to give it to the character who has dice as a weapon.\n\nVriska is messed up mostly because of Spidermom issues. Sure, it also has to do with her ruthless culture, expectations placed on those in her class, and how a child troll is supposed to prepare for a brutal life as an adult. But having to kill kids to feed her big, nasty mom her whole life probably isn't helping. This is some good  backstory stuff, because it provides a lot of cheap and easy fuel for those who wish to exonerate her for all her flaws and misdeeds. Blaming Spidermom is sort of the low-hanging fruit in the ever-raging Vriskourse.", "notes": null}]
