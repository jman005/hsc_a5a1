Like this blind miscreant right here. Dropping in exciting new characters and rolling out their wild personalities but only tantalizing the reader with little details about them while they troll the heroes from a distance...that's pretty scintillating stuff. So when we start doing the whole tour like this, promising a deep dive on all twelve trolls, you're more likely to look forward to the ones who got teased than the ones who didn't. Now you've finally hit one, and it's exciting. Her room's a HOT MESS. It's colorful, it's fun, it's kind of ridiculous. Is she...in a tree? Is she a damned LAWYER? She could have been anything, but she turned out to be this. I declare such morsels of discovery to be considered amongst the Good Shit\"\" of Homestuck's wild ride.", "notes": null}]
