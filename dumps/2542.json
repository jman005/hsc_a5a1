[{"id": 2542, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "The whereabouts of the Maid of Time: she had her fun with this smelly oaf and then dumped him for good because she's got loads of time traveling to do. The huge, tendriled monster there is the prototyped Glubglub's influence. (Who, sadly, we never get to see as a sprite. Possibly because I didn't want to draw it.) And as long as this note is rambling about nothing in particular, the close-up of Equius's shades is pretty interesting to think about if you know the far future of the story. That is,  a Void player wearing cracked shades that are strikingly reminiscent of the badly damaged state of the Furthest Ring, after Lord English starts rampaging through it, striking cracks that look like exactly that into the void itself. Equius is, oddly, a constituent part of English himself, it bears pointing out.", "notes": null}]
