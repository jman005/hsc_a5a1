[{"id": 2323, "page": null, "notes": null, "commentary": "Another (lade-like) pattern-breaking feature of Kanaya's character that she's diurnal and thrives in the sun. Most trolls have a dash of cheesy pop culture linked to their profile. With Kanaya, if you're detecting notes Of Twilight, you're not crazy, This also signals that jade bloods are rare relative to populations Of Other classes. Hard to say how rare, exactly. Considering she gets the \\"one of the few of your kind\\" refrain, jade bloods probably have the smallest population of any individual class, aside from fuchsia (which numbers exactly one on the entire planet, as you'll see soon). It's a class that has more to with breeding administration than other types of grunt work, for which much bigger populations would be more useful. Even so, Kanaya seems to be more notable than the average member of her class (which, admittedly, is true for most of these characters), in that she was chosen by a virgin mother grub. Her later-revealed vampiric qualities also seem to be unusual for her class, although I don't think it's ever really confirmed how unusual or common that trait is among jades. Since in the main Homestuck narrative we only ever get one solid example Of each blood type, it tends to be left as a point of speculation how representative that one character is Of the rest Of their class."}]
