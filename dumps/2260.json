It seemed like an innocuous throwaway item at the time, with its portal-less prognostication power making it come off as kind of a useless gag item. It is a very powerful artifact, though. They're seeds for Doc Scratch. One of these is an essential ectobiological component to Scratch, providing him with the essence of his omniscience, while Lil Cal provides the...other qualities. This means he can theoretically be created in any universe that contains both a seed and Cal. Jade's cue ball doesn't end up creating another Doc Scratch in their universe, but it does end up in Rose's hands and serves as a convenient means for his further manipulation of her.", "notes": null}]
