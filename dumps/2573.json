[{"id": 2573, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Lusus sprite dialogue is very rare. We get a tiny bit of dialogue from the mother grub sprite, but that's it. This is a relatively huge amount of dialogue coming from Terezi's baby dragon mom. It talks exactly how we'd imagine a recently hatched baby dragon who was suddenly given the ability to speak might talk. Why did I decide to give this particular sprite a bunch of lines, while leaving almost all the rest not only mute but completely unshown? Not sure I have a good answer for that. Believe it or not, sometimes there are decisions I make which can't be explained with several paragraphs worth of analysis.", "notes": null}]
