But is that really important? Hmm, let's say... NOPE. What's probably more important is showing that she's completing the bargain with Jack to get her package back. She is dogged and determined, particularly when it comes to the mail. Unfortunately for Jack, much later on he will be reminded of her dogged determination when she chases him through outer space for three solid years."}]
