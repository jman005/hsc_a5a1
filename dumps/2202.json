[{"id": 2202, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Here's a fun media gimmick lost in print. On the site, Doc's text was white on near-white, making it impossible to read. So you had to select the text with your mouse to highlight it (as Vriska openly laments here, doubling as a tip to the reader) in order to make it visible. Old-school message boards often used this as a low-tech method when users wanted to hide spoilers. This is a pretty fitting way to have the reader reveal Doc's text, since he's omniscient, knows the future, and can be pretty loose with certain facts. So his words can be regarded as a kind of spoiler which those conversing with him may or may not want to highlight and thus spoil themselves on.", "notes": null}]
