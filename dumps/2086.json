He has fully served his purpose, having programmed the game and gotten the two teams rolling. She now recognizes he will be completely useless until they have entered the session, so he might as well take a long nap. This pathetic situation is a microcosm of Sollux's entire role in the story.\n\n\"TEREZI AND I HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED A CONNECTION AND WE ARE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS HERE\" is really an incredibly funny line, consdering we've already observed their \"progress.\" It's unlikely that Karkat will ever mention the toilet incident to anyone. Another thing to note here is that, in a ridiculous way, this conversation actually demonstrates what good friends Karkat and Sollux really are BECAUSE of how often they apparently friend-dump each other, not in spite of it. That's how you know they're solid best bros, instead of kind of shitty, shallow, fake best bros like Karkat and Gamzee are. But that's much more of a Gamzee problem\n\nTrollian is impressively versatile software. For example, it can tell you if your buddy's computer exploded. If you want to know how it actually does this, I'm sorry, but I don't think I have an explanation. Gonna drop a truth bomb on your lap, heads up: it makes no sense and strains credulity. Oh, also Trollian can let you talk to people in the future too? That feature is KIND of cool. I GUESS.", "notes": null}]
