[{"id": 2420, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "Eridan essentially kills other kids' parents, making him an \"orphaner,\" just like his ancestor. As for the Caligula part of his handle, well, it's not hard to see a tyrannical, asshole emperor, known for his cruelty and perversity, as a historical blueprint for Eridan (who, if he doesn't quite live up to that image, certainly would like to). There's a little more going on here, though. \"Caligula\" shares the same root as \"caliginous,\" which is a word for darkness and a part of troll romance lexicon associated with blackrom. Eridan, a \"hopeless romantic,\" is particularly fixated on filling his black quadrant.", "notes": null}]
