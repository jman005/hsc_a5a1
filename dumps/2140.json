[{"id": 2140, "page": null, "title": null, "commentary": "A rare Kanaya/Aradia interaction. Pardon me as I point out the crack pairing convos every single time. Kanaya apparently knows some things about the future too. Why does she know them? Something to look out for. But what's probably more interesting, given that Kanaya is not known to be particularly underhanded or scheming, is that it doesn't seem she's told many people about the dire things that are about to happen. We can wonder why this is, but I don't know if we have to look too much  further than one of her known character traits: she tends to consider herself something of a confidante when it comes to her friendships with dangerous girls, and their dark secrets and proclivities (see: Vriska, then later, Rose). That's a flattering way of putting it. Another way would be: she's an enabler.", "notes": null}]
